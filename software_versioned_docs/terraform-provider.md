[Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/) allows you to manage your infrastructure as code. This means you can programmatically manage resources, user access, and networking using Terraform and Terraform Providers.

Terraform providers act as an interface between Terraform and different platforms or services that you might use in your infrastructure implementation. You can use the [Astro Terraform Provider](https://github.com/astronomer/terraform-provider-astro) to programmatically manage your Astro resources, Deployments, and user management.

The Astro Terraform Provider is open source and available through the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/astronomer/astro/0.3.0). You can also clone the provider from its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/astronomer/terraform-provider-astro), if you also want to adapt it for your custom use case, or submit a suggesiont with a pull request.
