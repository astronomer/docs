---

To install the Astronomer CLI on Windows, you have the following options:

- Install the Unix-based CLI on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- Install the Windows-based CLI.

> **Note:** Both options require Windows 10 or later.

## Astronomer CLI on Windows Subsystem for Linux

Before you start the setup and configuration process for the Astronomer CLI on the WSL, make sure:
 - You're running the bash terminal
 - You have [WSL enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
 - You're running Windows 10 version 2004 or later (Build 19041 or later) or Windows 11

**Note:** Astronomer recommends using Ubuntu as your linux distribution for WSL.

The complete WSL installation guide is available here: [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

### Step 1. Install Docker CE for Windows

See [Docker for Windows Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

After finishing the installation, use the distro shell or a Windows Terminal to open a new WSL session. Run `docker run hello-world` in your WSL instance to ensure everything works as expected.

When you run Docker-compose up, go to `/c/Users/name/dev/myapplication` first, or your volume won't work. Don't access `/mnt/c` directly.

### Step 2. CLI Install

Finish the installation and start the deployment DAGs. See [CLI Quickstart Guide](cli-quickstart.md).

## Astronomer CLI on Windows 10 (PowerShell)

Use the following instructions to install a Windows adapted version of the Astronomer CLI.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Windows 10
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

### Step 2. Enable WSL-2 Based Docker Engine or Hyper-V (legacy)

Make sure that the WSL 2 based engine is enabled in Docker Settings (preferred). If this is not possible, enable Hyper-V (legacy). This is required to run Docker and Linux Containers.

If you have any issues with Docker, see [Docker's Troubleshooting Guide for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/).

### Step 3. Download the Astronomer CLI

Currently, Astronomer on Windows outside of WSL is only supported by Astronomer CLI versions 0.28 and later.

You can download the latest version of the CLI [here](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases/). Select an asset that includes windows_386.zip in the filepath.

### Step 4. Extract the contents

You should now have a zip file on your computer that contains the following:

- CHANGELOG
- README
- LICENSE
- A file titled `astro.exe`

Move `astro.exe` to a location where it can't be deleted.

### Step 5. Add Executable to Path
Add the location of `astro.exe` to your %PATH% environment variable. See [How to Add to Windows PATH Environment Variable](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/).

### Step 6. Final Command

Open your Terminal or PowerShell console and run the following:

```
C:\Windows\system32>astro version
Astronomer CLI Version: 0.8.2
Git Commit: f5cdab8f832da3c6184a7ac167b491e3bac3c022
```

If you receive a response similar to what is shown, your set up is complete.

## Potential Postgres Error

The following error might appear when you run `astro dev start` on your newly created workspace:

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  8.192kB
Step 1/1 : FROM quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow:latest-onbuild
# Executing 5 build triggers

```

This is an issue pulling Postgres. To correct it, run:

```
Docker pull postgres:10.1-alpine
```
