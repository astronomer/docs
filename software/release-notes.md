### Import Identity Provider User Groups as Teams

You now can import existing identity provider (IDP) groups into Astronomer Software as Teams, which are groups of Astronomer users that have the same set of permissions to a given Workspace or Deployment. Importing existing IDP groups as Teams enables swift onboarding to Astronomer and better control over multiple user permissions.

For more information about configuring this feature, read [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md). To learn more about adding and setting permissions for Teams via the Astronomer UI, read [User Permissions](workspace-permissions.md#via-teams).

### Additional Improvements

- Astronomer now supports `prefer` and `require` SSL modes for connecting to PGBouncer. You can set this SSL mode via the `global.ssl.mode` value in your `config.yaml` file. Note that in v0.28.0, this feature works only with AWS and Azure.
- You can now set [Grafana environment variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/#override-configuration-with-environment-variables) using the `grafana.extraEnvVars` setting in your `config.yaml` file.
- Added a new **Ephemeral Storage Overwrite Gigabytes** slider to the Git Sync configuration screen. You can configure this slider to allocate more memory for syncing larger Git repos.
- Added a new **Sync Timeout** slider to the Git Sync configuration screen. You can configure this slider to set a maximum allowed length of time for syncing a Git repo.

### Bug Fixes

- Added AWS RDS certificates to list of trusted certificates
