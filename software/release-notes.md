## 0.31.2

Release date: January 31, 2023

### Additional improvements

- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.25](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/).
- You can now configure custom annotations for Houston ingress by setting `astronomer.houston.ingress.annotation` in your `config.yaml` file. 
- The System Admin **Deployments** list in the Astronomer UI is now paginated. 
- PgBouncer now utilizes graceful shutdowns.
- Errors related to the git-sync Kubernetes pod now appear in the Astro UI (potentially not in release)
- You can now tune the git-sync relay service's resource usage by setting the following values in your `config.yaml` file:

    - `astronomer.gitSyncRelay.gitSyncResources`
    - `astronomer.gitSyncRelay.gitDaemonResources`
    - `astronomer.gitSyncRelay.securityContext`

- You can now set `timeoutSeconds` for both `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` in the Prometheus Helm chart.
- Fixed an issue where Deployments with many DAGs could not be successfully upgraded due to a short timeout.
- Houston API now logs an installation's deployed image versions whenever a GraphQL mutation is completed.

### Bug fixes 

- Fixed an issue where a user deactivated through SCIM would leave behind orphan Deployments and Workspaces. 
- Service accounts and users can no longer create users through the Houston API when SCIm is enabled. 
- Database migrations for a Deployment now use the same amount of resources as configured for the Deployment's scheduler. This should limit OOM errors when migrating large DAGs.
- Fixed an issue in the Software UI where refreshing pages listing Workspace or Deployment service accounts resulted in an error.
- Fixed an issue where PgBouncer didn't work if you pulled its image from a private registry.
- When you view a user through a Teams list as a System Admin and return to the list, you now return to the Teams list instead of the System Admin users list. 
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:
    - [CVE-2022-23529](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23529)

## 0.31.0

Release date: December 7, 2022

### New root user role

Astronomer Software's role-based access control (RBAC) system now supports a single root user for each installation. The root user has a non-configurable username and autogenerated password stored as a Kubernetes secret in your installation. 

See [Manage the root user](manage-root-user.md).

### Manage Astronomer users through a SCIM integration 

Astronomer Software now supports managing users through System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), which allows you to automatically provision and deprovision users based on templates for access and permissions. See [Manage users with SCIM](integrate-auth-system.md#manage-users-with-scim).

### Invite users only through Teams

Using the new root user feature, you can now configure Astronomer Software so that users are managed exclusively through Teams. This helps you better integrate with your identity provider (IdP) by ensuring that all users on your platform are authenticated and managed through the IdP. See [Disable individual user management](import-idp-groups.md#disable-individual-user-management).

### New default resource limits and requests 

Astronomer Software 0.31 includes new default resource limits and requests on the following resources: 

- Alertmanager
- Elasticsearch
- NATS
- PostrgeSQL
- STAN
- Nginx
- Grafana
- Blackbox exporter

You might experience OOMKill errors or unexpected behavior after upgrading if you use resources beyond the new default limits. To minimize disruption, view resource usage for these components in [Grafana](grafana-metrics.md) prior to upgrade and compare this usage to the default resource limits in the [Astronomer Helm chart](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer/blob/master/charts/astronomer/values.yaml). 

If your current usage is expected and higher than the default resource limits, update the limits in your `config.yaml` file before upgrading to Astronomer Software 0.31.

### Additional improvements 

- You can now set a custom security context for `es-client` by setting `elasticsearch.client.securityContext.capabilities.add={}` in the ElasticSearch Helm chart.
- The **Deployment users** page is now paginated in the Astronomer UI.
- You can now set `astronomer.registry.logLevel` to filter which types of logs appear in your Docker registry.
- The default Git-sync interval is now 1 instead of 0.
- You can now configure a Deployment to have 0 triggerer components.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.useAutoCompleteForSensativeFields=false` to disable autocomplete on sensitive fields in the Astronomer UI.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.shouldLogUsername=true` to include user email addresses in audit logs for logins through the Houston API.
- [Git sync-based Deployments](deploy-git-sync.md) now have a dedicated git-sync relay pod, service, and network policy.
  
### Bug fixes

- The Astronomer UI now stores user tokens with `httpOnly` and `secure` flags.
- Fixed an issue where the Astronomer UI would occasionally show an incorrect **Extra AU** number for Deployments. 
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2022-37601](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3043105)
    - [CVE-2022-43680](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43680)
    - [CVE-2022-40674](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40674)
  
- Fixed an issue where you could not access Astronomer Software's Docker registry if you had access to more than 100 Deployments. 
- Fixed an issue where the Astronomer UI did not show the correct last used dates for service accounts. 
- Fixed an issue where NATS would send false Deployment alert emails.
- Fixed an issue where the configuration in `astronomer.houston.updateRuntimeCheck.url` was ignored if not all supported Deployment image versions were present in the destination URL.
