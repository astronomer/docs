description: Install the Telescope tool to collect Airflow metrics and usage for Astronomer.

Telescope is a CLI developed by Astronomer for generating additional metrics from your Airflow environments. It connects directly to Airflow and generates snapshots of your usage and configurations at various points in time. Astronomer uses this information to troubleshoot your environments and verify pricing based on task usage.

Telescope doesn't have direct access to your Airflow environments. Instead, you run Telescope commands to observe the current state of an Airflow environment at a given point in time. Based on what it observes, Telescope generates a report which you can share with Astronomer support.  

You must run Telescope on all Software Deployments in your cloud, but you can additionally install it on local projects running with the Astro CLI for troubleshooting purposes.

## Prerequisites

To observe a local environment running with Telescope, you need:

- `docker exec` permissions.
- Access to `docker.sock`.
- Python 3.6.
- An Airflow metadata db using Postgresql, Mysql, or Sqlite.

To observe a Deployment with Telescope, you need:

- kubectl.
- Permission to list nodes and exec into Pods.

## Install the Telescope CLI

Install the Telescope CLI on a system that has direct access to your Airflow environments.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="binary"
    values={[
        {label: 'Binary', value: 'binary'},
        {label: 'Pip', value: 'pip'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="binary">

To install the Telescope binary, run the following commands:

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/astronomer/telescope/releases/latest/download/telescope-linux-x86_64
$ chmod +x telescope-linux-x86_64
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pip">

To install Telescope using pip, run the following command:

```sh
pip install telescope --find-links https://github.com/astronomer/telescope/releases/latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Observe deployed environments

For a given Deployment:

1. Exec into the Deployment:

    ```sh
    kubectl exec deploy/<deployment-release-name>-scheduler
    ```

2. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    telescope --kubernetes --organization-name <your-organization>
    ```

    This command observes your Deployment's scheduler and outputs the results of the observation to a file ending in `data.json`.

:::info

By default, Telescope only observes Pods with the label `component=scheduler`. If your Deployments use an alternative label to denote scheduler Pods, use the `--label-selector` selector in your command. For example, if your label for scheduler pods is `role=scheduler`, you would run.  

```sh
--kubernetes --organization-name <your-organization> --label-selector "role=scheduler"
```

:::

## Observe local environments

Open your Astro project and run the following command:

```sh
telescope --docker
```

This command observes your Airflow environment's scheduler container and outputs the results of the observation to a file ending in `data.json`.

## Telescope report data

After Telescope observes an Airflow environment, it generates a file ending in `data.json` with information about the the environment. Some of the report's details include:

- Airflow version
- Provider packages and versions
- Airflow configurations
- The names of Airflow variables, connections, and settings (no values)
- DAG and task-level configurations
- Task run usage

## Send Telescope reports to Astronomer support

1. In the [Astronomer support portal](https://support.astronomer.io/), create a ticket called `<Organization-name>: Telescope Results`
2. Attach the `data.json` file that was generated by Telescope to the ticket.

## Advanced configuration

Telescope includes advanced settings for customizing your reports and observing Airflow environments running in containers with custom names. See the [Telescope README](https://github.com/astronomer/telescope) or run `telescope --help` for more information about these settings.
