description: Use Kibana to monitor platform-wide Airflow logs from Astronomer Software.
---

All Airflow logs from your Astronomer logs will flow to Elasticsearch and can be visualized on Kibana. Like Grafana, this view is only available to system admins.

## Setup

To setup logging in Kibana, navigate to `kibana.BASEDOMAIN`

![Index Pattern](https://assets2.astronomer.io/main/docs/ee/index_pattern.png)


Navigate to `Management` and create an index pattern for `fluentd.*`
Elasticsearch uses [index patterns](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index-patterns.html) to organize how you explore data. Setting `fluentd.*` as the index means that Kibana will display all logs from all deployments (Astronomer uses `fluentd` to ship logs from pods to ElasticSearch).

Set `@timestamp` as the  `Time Filter` on the next screen.

## Discover

Once the index pattern has been confirmed, the `Discover` tab will show logs as they come in.

From this view, you can add filters to see logs as they come in from all Airflow deployments. You can also add fields to filter by:


## Dashboards

Custom dashboards can be created in the `Dashboard` view.
