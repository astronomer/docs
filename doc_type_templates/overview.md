- First section answers the questions - what who when why how
    - What is the feature/tool/technology?
    - Who should use this feature?
    - When/under what conditions does the feature do something?
    - Why is it useful?
    - How does it relate to other features or tools?

- Next, write a couple of sentences introducing the different sections you will cover in this page. These can be in bullet points, or they might be individually defined terms. It's okay if they are the same terms or phrases you use as your headers for the next sections.

- Ends with a couple of sentences about similar topics that are not addressed in the overview page.

<!--see CI/CD Template overview for examples of this structure https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/ci-cd-templates/template-overview -->

## Related concept 1
The related concepts/processes/options sections go into more specific detail and nuance about the subjects you introduced in the introduction. We use a similar structure that's introduced in the intro, except instead of looking at a high level or general view of the topic, go into specificity and depth.

- What specific terms or concepts related to the overview need to be defined?
- Who should consider using it and what other options they need to include/address or prerequisites?
- What conflicts, contraindications, or problems might be important for users to know?
- Are there any relevant code examples, templates, or GitHub repos to include or refer to?
