[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is an open-source vector database and similarity search engine designed for AI applications.

In this tutorial, you'll use the [Qdrant Airflow provider](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-qdrant/stable/index.html) to write a DAG that generates embeddings in parallel and performs semantic retrieval based on user input.

Airflow is useful when running operations in Qdrant based on data events or building parallel tasks for generating vector embeddings. By using Airflow, you can set up monitoring and alerts for your pipelines for full observability.

## Time to complete

This tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

- A running Qdrant instance. A [free instance](https://cloud.qdrant.io) is available.
- The Astro CLI. See [Install the Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli).
- A [HuggingFace token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to generate embeddings.

## Step 1: Set up the project

1. Create a new Astro project:

```bash
mkdir qdrant-airflow-tutorial && cd qdrant-airflow-tutorial
astro dev init
```

2. To use Qdrant within Airflow, install the Qdrant Airflow provider by adding the following to your `requirements.txt` file:

```text
apache-airflow-providers-qdrant==1.1.0
```

## Step 2: Configure credentials

Add the following configuration to your `.env` file to create Airflow connections between Airflow and HuggingFace and Qdrant.

```text
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
AIRFLOW_CONN_QDRANT_DEFAULT='{
    "conn_type": "qdrant",
    "host": "xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333",
    "password": "<YOUR_QDRANT_API_KEY>"
}'
```

## Step 3: Add the data corpus

Paste the following sample data into a file called `books.txt` within your `include` directory.

```text
1 | To Kill a Mockingbird (1960) | fiction | Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel explores racial injustice and moral growth through the eyes of young Scout Finch in the Deep South.
2 | Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (1997) | fantasy | J.K. Rowling's magical tale follows Harry Potter as he discovers his wizarding heritage and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
3 | The Great Gatsby (1925) | fiction | F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel delves into the glitz, glamour, and moral decay of the Jazz Age through the eyes of narrator Nick Carraway and his enigmatic neighbour, Jay Gatsby.
4 | 1984 (1949) | dystopian | George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece paints a chilling picture of a totalitarian society where individuality is suppressed and the truth is manipulated by a powerful regime.
5 | The Catcher in the Rye (1951) | fiction | J.D. Salinger's iconic novel follows disillusioned teenager Holden Caulfield as he navigates the complexities of adulthood and society's expectations in post-World War II America.
6 | Pride and Prejudice (1813) | romance | Jane Austen's beloved novel revolves around the lively and independent Elizabeth Bennet as she navigates love, class, and societal expectations in Regency-era England.
7 | The Hobbit (1937) | fantasy | J.R.R. Tolkien's adventure follows Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who embarks on a quest with a group of dwarves to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug.
8 | The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955) | fantasy | J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy trilogy follows the journey of Frodo Baggins to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron in the land of Middle-earth.
9 | The Alchemist (1988) | fiction | Paulo Coelho's philosophical novel follows Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy, on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening as he searches for a hidden treasure.
10 | The Da Vinci Code (2003) | mystery/thriller | Dan Brown's gripping thriller follows symbologist Robert Langdon as he unravels clues hidden in art and history while trying to solve a murder mystery with far-reaching implications.
```

## Step 4: Create your DAG

1. In your `dags` folder, create a file called `books_recommend.py`.

2. Copy the following code into the file.

```python
import os
import requests

from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from airflow.models.baseoperator import chain
from airflow.models.param import Param
from airflow.providers.qdrant.hooks.qdrant import QdrantHook
from airflow.providers.qdrant.operators.qdrant import QdrantIngestOperator
from pendulum import datetime
from qdrant_client import models


QDRANT_CONNECTION_ID = "qdrant_default"
DATA_FILE_PATH = "include/books.txt"
COLLECTION_NAME = "airflow_tutorial_collection"

EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION = 384
SIMILARITY_METRIC = models.Distance.COSINE


def embed(text: str) -> list:
    HUGGINFACE_URL = f"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/pipeline/feature-extraction/{EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID}"
    response = requests.post(
        HUGGINFACE_URL,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN')}"},
        json={"inputs": [text], "options": {"wait_for_model": True}},
    )
    return response.json()[0]


@dag(
    dag_id="books_recommend",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 18),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
    params={"preference": Param("Something suspenseful and thrilling.", type="string")},

    def import_books(text_file_path: str) -> list:
        data = []
        with open(text_file_path, "r") as f:
            for line in f:
                _, title, genre, description = line.split("|")
                data.append(
                    {
                        "title": title.strip(),
                        "genre": genre.strip(),
                        "description": description.strip(),
                    }
                )

        return data

    @task
    def init_collection():
        hook = QdrantHook(conn_id=QDRANT_CONNECTION_ID)

        hook.conn.recreate_collection(
            COLLECTION_NAME,
            vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
                size=EMBEDDING_DIMENSION, distance=SIMILARITY_METRIC
            ),
        )

    @task
    def embed_description(data: dict) -> list:
        return embed(data["description"])

    books = import_books(text_file_path=DATA_FILE_PATH)
    embeddings = embed_description.expand(data=books)

    qdrant_vector_ingest = QdrantIngestOperator(
        conn_id=QDRANT_CONNECTION_ID,
        task_id="qdrant_vector_ingest",
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        payload=books,
        vectors=embeddings,
    )

    @task
    def embed_preference(**context) -> list:
        user_mood = context["params"]["preference"]
        response = embed(text=user_mood)

        return response

    @task
    def search_qdrant(
        preference_embedding: list,
    ) -> None:
        hook = QdrantHook(conn_id=QDRANT_CONNECTION_ID)

        result = hook.conn.search(
            collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
            query_vector=preference_embedding,
            limit=1,
            with_payload=True,
        )

        print("Book recommendation: " + result[0].payload["title"])
        print("Description: " + result[0].payload["description"])

    chain(
        init_collection(),
        qdrant_vector_ingest,
        search_qdrant(embed_preference()),
    )


recommend_book()

```

- `import_books`: This task reads a text file containing information about the books (such as title, genre, and description) and then returns the data as a list of dictionaries.

- `init_collection`: This task initializes a collection in the Qdrant database, where we will store the vector representations of the book descriptions. The `recreate_collection()` function deletes a collection first if it already exists. Trying to create a collection that already exists throws an error.

- `embed_description`: This is a dynamic task that creates one mapped task instance for each book in the list. The task uses the `embed` function to generate vector embeddings for each description. To use a different embedding model, you can adjust the `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID` and `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` values.

- `embed_user_preference`: Here, we take a userâ€™s input and convert it into a vector using the same pre-trained model used for the book descriptions.

- `qdrant_vector_ingest`: This task ingests the book data into the Qdrant collection using the `QdrantIngestOperator`, associating each book description with its corresponding vector embeddings.

- `search_qdrant`: Finally, this task performs a search in the Qdrant database using the vectorized user preference. It finds the most relevant book in the collection based on vector similarity.

## Step 5: Run your DAG

1. Run `astro dev start` in your Astro project to start Airflow and open the Airflow UI at `localhost:8080`.

2. In the Airflow UI, run the `books_recommend` DAG by clicking the play button. You'll be asked for input about your book preference.
