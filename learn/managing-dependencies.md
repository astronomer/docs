[Dependencies](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/tasks.html#relationships) are a powerful and popular Airflow feature. In Airflow, your pipelines are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Each task is a node in the graph and dependencies are the directed edges that determine how to move through the graph. Because of this, dependencies are key to following data engineering best practices because they help you define flexible pipelines with atomic tasks.

Throughout this guide, the following terms are used to describe task dependencies:

- **Upstream task**: A task that must reach a specified state before a dependent task can run.
- **Downstream task**: A dependent task that cannot run until an upstream task reaches a specified state.

In this guide you'll learn about the many ways you can implement dependencies in Airflow, including:

- Basic task dependencies.
- Dynamic dependencies.
- Dependencies with task groups.
- Dependencies with the TaskFlow API.
- Trigger rules.

To view a video presentation of these concepts, see [Manage Dependencies Between Airflow Deployments, DAGs, and Tasks](https://www.astronomer.io/events/webinars/manage-dependencies-between-airflow-deployments-dags-tasks/). 

The focus of this guide is dependencies between tasks in the same DAG. If you need to implement dependencies between DAGs, see [Cross-DAG dependencies](cross-dag-dependencies.md).

## Assumed knowledge

To get the most out of this guide, you should have an understanding of:

- Basic Airflow concepts. See [Introduction to Apache Airflow](intro-to-airflow.md).

## Basic dependencies

Basic dependencies between Airflow tasks can be set in the following ways:

- Using bitshift operators (`<<` and `>>`)
- Using the `set_upstream` and `set_downstream` methods

For example, if you have a DAG with four sequential tasks, the dependencies can be set in four ways:

- Using `set_downstream()`:

    ```python
    t0.set_downstream(t1)
    t1.set_downstream(t2)
    t2.set_downstream(t3)
    ```

- Using `set_upstream()`:

    ```python
    t3.set_upstream(t2)
    t2.set_upstream(t1)
    t1.set_upstream(t0)
    ```

- Using `>>`

    ```python
    t0 >> t1 >> t2 >> t3
    ```

- Using `<<`

    ```python
    t3 << t2 << t1 << t0
    ```

All of these methods are equivalent and result in the DAG shown in the following image:

![Basic Dependencies](/img/guides/basic_dependencies.png)

Astronomer recommends using a single method consistently. Using both bitshift operators and `set_upstream`/`set_downstream` in your DAGs can overly-complicate your code. 

To set a dependency where two downstream tasks are dependent on the same upstream task, use lists or tuples. For example:

```python
# Dependencies with lists
t0 >> t1 >> [t2, t3]

# Dependencies with tuples
t0 >> t1 >> (t2, t3)
```

These statements are equivalent and result in the DAG shown in the following image: 

![List Dependencies](/img/guides/list_dependencies.png)

Airflow can't parse dependencies between two lists. For example, `[t0, t1] >> [t2, t3]` returns an error. To set these dependencies, use the Airflow [`chain` function](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/baseoperator.py#L1650). For example:

<CodeBlock language="python">{dependencies_example_1}</CodeBlock>

This image shows the resulting DAG:

![Chain Dependencies](/img/guides/chain.png)

With the `chain` function, any lists or tuples you include must be of the same length.

## Dynamic dependencies

If you generate tasks dynamically in your DAG, you should define the dependencies within the context of the code used to dynamically create the tasks.

In the following example, a set of parallel dynamic tasks is generated by looping through a list of endpoints. Each `generate_files` task is downstream of `start` and upstream of `send_email`.

```python
@dag(
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule="@daily",
    catchup=False
)
def data_to_s3():

    t0 = EmptyOperator(task_id="start")

    send_email = EmailOperator(
        task_id="send_email",
        to=email_to,
        subject="Data to S3 DAG",
        html_content="<p>The data to S3 DAG completed successfully. \
        Files can now be found on S3. <p>"
    )
    
    for endpoint in endpoints:
        generate_files = PythonOperator(
            task_id="generate_file_{0}".format(endpoint),
            python_callable=upload_to_s3,
            op_kwargs={"endpoint": endpoint, "date": date}
        )
        
        t0 >> generate_files >> send_email


data_to_s3()

```

## Task group dependencies

[Task groups](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html#taskgroups) are a UI-based grouping concept available in Airflow 2.0 and later. For more information on task groups, including how to create them and when to use them, see [Using Task Groups in Airflow](task-groups.md).

When working with task groups, it is important to note that dependencies can be set both inside and outside of the group. For example, in the following DAG code there is a start task, a task group with two dependent tasks, and an end task that needs to happen sequentially. The dependencies between the two tasks in the task group are set within the task group's context (`t1 >> t2`). The dependencies between the task group and the start and end tasks are set within the DAG's context (`t0 >> tg1 >> t3`).

    t2 = EmptyOperator(task_id="task2")

    t1 >> t2

t3 = EmptyOperator(task_id="end")

# Set Task Group's (tg1) dependencies
t0 >> tg1() >> t3
```

    t2 = EmptyOperator(task_id="task2")

    t1 >> t2
# End Task Group definition
    
t3 = EmptyOperator(task_id="end")

# Set Task Group's (tg1) dependencies
t0 >> tg1 >> t3
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## TaskFlow API dependencies

The [TaskFlow API](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/taskflow.html), available in Airflow 2.0 and later, lets you turn Python functions into Airflow tasks using the `@task` decorator. 

If your DAG has only Python functions that are all defined with the decorator, invoke Python functions to set dependencies. For example, in the following DAG there are two dependent tasks, `get_a_cat_fact` and `print_the_cat_fact`. To set the dependencies, you invoke the function `print_the_cat_fact(get_a_cat_fact())`:

<CodeBlock language="python">{dependencies_example_2_taskflow}</CodeBlock>

This image shows the resulting DAG:

![TaskFlow Dependencies](/img/guides/dependency_taskflow.png)

If your DAG has a mix of Python function tasks defined with decorators and tasks defined with traditional operators, you can set the dependencies by assigning the decorated task invocation to a variable and then defining the dependencies normally. For example, in the DAG below the `upload_data_to_s3` task is defined by the `@task` decorator and invoked with `upload_data = upload_data_to_s3(s3_bucket, test_s3_key)`. The `upload_data` variable is used in the last line to define dependencies.

```python
@dag(
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule="@daily",
    catchup=False
)
def sagemaker_model():

    @task
    def upload_data_to_s3(s3_bucket, test_s3_key):
        """
        Uploads validation data to S3 from /include/data 
        """
        s3_hook = S3Hook(aws_conn_id="aws-sagemaker")

        # Take string, upload to S3 using predefined method
        s3_hook.load_file(
            filename="include/data/test.csv", 
            key=test_s3_key, 
            bucket_name=s3_bucket, 
            replace=True
        )

    upload_data = upload_data_to_s3(s3_bucket, test_s3_key)

    predict = SageMakerTransformOperator(
        task_id="predict",
        config=transform_config,
        aws_conn_id="aws-sagemaker"
    )

    results_to_redshift = S3ToRedshiftOperator(
        task_id="save_results",
        aws_conn_id="aws-sagemaker",
        s3_bucket=s3_bucket,
        s3_key=output_s3_key,
        schema="PUBLIC",
        table="results",
        copy_options=["csv"],
    )

    upload_data >> predict >> results_to_redshift


sagemaker_model()

```

## Trigger rules

When you set dependencies between tasks, the default Airflow behavior is to run a task only when all upstream tasks have succeeded. You can use [trigger rules](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html#trigger-rules) to change this default behavior.

The following options are available:

- all_success: (default) The task runs only when all upstream tasks have succeeded.
- all_failed: The task runs only when all upstream tasks are in a failed or upstream\_failed state.
- all_done: The task runs once all upstream tasks are done with their execution.
- all_skipped: The task runs only when all upstream tasks have been skipped. 
- one_failed: The task runs when at least one upstream task has failed. 
- one_success: The task runs when at least one upstream task has succeeded.
- one_done: The task runs when at least one upstream task has either succeeded or failed.
- none_failed: The task runs only when all upstream tasks have succeeded or been skipped.
- none_failed_min_one_success: The task runs only when all upstream tasks have not failed or upstream_failed, and at least one upstream task has succeeded.
- none_skipped: The task runs only when no upstream task is in a skipped state.
- always: The task runs at any time.

### Branching and trigger rules

One common scenario where you might need to implement trigger rules is if your DAG contains conditional logic such as [branching](airflow-branch-operator.md). In these cases, `one_success` might be a more appropriate rule than `all_success`.

In the following example DAG there is a simple branch with a downstream task that needs to run if either of the branches are followed. With the `all_success` rule, the `end` task never runs because all but one of the `branch` tasks is always ignored and therefore doesn't have a success state. If you change the trigger rule to `one_success`, then the `end` task can run so long as one of the branches successfully completes.
