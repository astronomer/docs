Airflow offers the possibility to customize its UI with plugins. One small but impactful addition is adding extra links in the **Details** view of either existing or custom operators. These operator extra links can point to static websites, for example to access documentation relevant to the operator, or dynamic links created from information during the task instance run. 

![BashOperator with extra link](/img/guides/extra_links_tutorial_bashoperator.png)

This tutorial shows how to add both static and dynamic extra links using an Airflow plugin, as well as how to add an extra link directly in a custom operator.

After you complete this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Add a static operator extra link to any operator using an Airflow plugin.
- Modify an existing operator to push an additional value to XCom.
- Add a dynamic operator extra link to any operator using an Airflow plugin.
- Add an operator extra link to a custom operator defined in an Airflow provider.

:::tip

Extra links can be also be added to operators when creating an [Airflow provider](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html). In general, adding an operator extra link via plugin as described in this tutorial is easier for use in a limited number of Airflow instances. However, if you are planning to use the extra link in a large number of deployments, consider adding them to an Airflow provider instead.

## Time to complete

This tutorial takes approximately 1 hour to complete.

## Assumed knowledge

To get the most out of this tutorial, make sure you have an understanding of:

- Navigating an Airflow Project. See [Get started with Apache Airflow](get-started-with-airflow.md).
- Airflow Plugins. See [Import plugins to Airflow](using-airflow-plugins.md).
- Airflow Connections. See [Manage connections in Apache Airflow](connections.md).
- Intermediate knowledge of Python. See [the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

## Prerequisites

- The [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli).

## Step 1: Create an Astro project

Set up Airflow by creating a new Astro project:

```sh
$ mkdir astro-extra-link-tutorial && cd astro-extra-link-tutorial
$ astro dev init
```

## Step 2: Create a DAG using the SimpleHttpOperator

First you will add a static operator extra link to the SimpleHttpOperator, which will link to the [Mozilla HTTP documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) on every task instance created by this operator.

1. Create a new Python file named `plugin_test_dag.py` in the `dags` folder of your Airflow project.

2. Copy and paste the following DAG code into your file:

    ```python
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import SimpleHttpOperator
    from pendulum import datetime

    with DAG(
        dag_id="plugin_test_dag",
        start_date=datetime(2022, 11, 1),
        schedule=None,
        catchup=False
    ):

        call_api_simple = SimpleHttpOperator(
            task_id="call_api_simple",
            http_conn_id="random_user_api_conn",
            method="GET"
        )
    ```

This DAG has one SimpleHttpOperator task that posts a GET request to an API provided in the `random_user_api_conn` connection.

## Step 3: Add a static operator extra link

Create an [Airflow plugin](using-airflow-plugins.md) to add an extra link to the operator.

1. Create a new Python file named `my_extra_link_plugin.py` in the `plugins` folder of your Airflow project. 

2. Copy paste the following code into your file.

    ```python
    from airflow.plugins_manager import AirflowPlugin
    from airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperatorLink
    from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import SimpleHttpOperator

    # define the extra link
    class HTTPDocsLink(BaseOperatorLink):
        # name the link button in the UI
        name = "HTTP docs"

        # add the button to one or more operators
        operators = [SimpleHttpOperator]

        # provide the link
        def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key=None):
            return "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP"

    # define the plugin class
    class AirflowExtraLinkPlugin(AirflowPlugin):
        name = "extra_link_plugin"
        operator_extra_links = [
            HTTPDocsLink(),
        ]
    ```

This script accomplishes the following:

- Imports the `AirflowPlugin` class which serves as a base class for custom plugins as well as the `BaseOperatorLink` from which classes defining custom extra links inherit.
- Defines a custom extra link class called `HTTPDocsLink` which inherits from `BaseOperatorLink` and adds an external link button in the Airflow UI to all operators provided to its `operators` attribute. In the example, we provide the `SimpleHttpOperator`.
- Provides a static link to the HTTP documentation on Mozilla to the `.get_link()` method of the `HTTPDocsLink`. This method adds any link returned to the link button in the Airflow UI.
- Creates the `AirflowExtraLinkPlugin` class which inherits from `AirflowPlugin`. This class will plug objects of [different plugin types](using-airflow-plugins.md) into Airflow. The plugin is given the name `extra_link_plugin` and its `operator_extra_links` attribute contains all extra links objects that have been defined in this plugin script. For now it contains only `HTTPDocsLink()`.

## Step 4: Add an HTTP connection

1. In your terminal, run `astro dev start` in your Astro project directory to start up Airflow. If your Airflow instance is already running, use `astro dev restart` to restart it in order to load any changes made in the `plugins` folder.

2. Add an HTTP connection called `random_user_api_conn` to `http://randomuser.me/api/` in the Airflow UI. This API will return data about a randomly generated user persona. Feel free to use a different API, the content returned will not be relevant for this tutorial.

    ![HTTP connection](/img/guides/extra_links_tutorial_add_http_connection.png)

## Step 5: Use your static operator extra link

1. Run the `plugins_test_dag`.

2. In the Grid View click on the green square showing the successful run of the `call_api_simple` task. Select the **Details** tab and scroll down to see the extra link button called **HTTP docs**.

    ![HTTP docs button](/img/guides/extra_links_tutorial_HTTPDocsLink_button.png)

3. Click on the button to visit the HTTP docs on Mozilla.

## Step 6: Create a custom operator

Linking to relevant docs from an operator is useful, but often you want to add a dynamic link that uses information returned by the operator to decide where to link to. The second half of this tutorial will cover how to modify an operator to push the value you need to [XComs](airflow-passing-data-between-tasks.md) and retrieve that value in your Airflow plugin.

1. Create a new file called `cat_http.py` in the `include` folder of your Airflow project.

2. Copy the following code into the file.

    ```python
    from airflow.providers.http.operators.http import SimpleHttpOperator
    from airflow.providers.http.hooks.http import HttpHook
    from airflow.utils.operator_helpers import determine_kwargs
    from airflow.exceptions import AirflowException

    class CatHttpOperator(SimpleHttpOperator):

        # initialize with identical arguments to the parent class
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(**kwargs)

        def execute(self, context):

            http = HttpHook(
                self.method,
                http_conn_id=self.http_conn_id,
                auth_type=self.auth_type,
                tcp_keep_alive=self.tcp_keep_alive,
                tcp_keep_alive_idle=self.tcp_keep_alive_idle,
                tcp_keep_alive_count=self.tcp_keep_alive_count,
                tcp_keep_alive_interval=self.tcp_keep_alive_interval,
            )

            self.log.info("Calling HTTP method")

            response = http.run(
                self.endpoint, self.data, self.headers, self.extra_options
            )
            if self.log_response:
                self.log.info(response.text)
            if self.response_check:
                kwargs = determine_kwargs(self.response_check, [response], context)
                if not self.response_check(response, **kwargs):
                    raise AirflowException("Response check returned False.")
            if self.response_filter:
                kwargs = determine_kwargs(self.response_filter, [response], context)
                return self.response_filter(response, **kwargs)

            # pushing the HTTP status response to XComs
            context["ti"].xcom_push(key="status_code", value=response.status_code)

            return response.text
    ```

    The code above defines a custom version of the `SimpleHttpOperator`, called the `CatHttpOperator`. The change consists of adding one line before the `return` statement of the `.execute()` method which is `context["ti"].xcom_push(key="status_code", value=response.status_code)`. This line pushes the `status_code` attribute of the `response` object to XComs and associates it with the key `status_code`. The rest of the `.execute()` method is identical to the parent operator (compare the source code of the [SimpleHttpOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/http/operators/http.py)).

3. Add an empty Python file with the name `__init__.py` to your `include` folder to allow module imports from the folder.

This is all that is necessary to modify an existing operator.

:::info

Before Airflow 2.0, custom operators and hooks were added as plugins. This pattern has been deprecated and [custom operators and hooks](airflow-importing-custom-hooks-operators.md) can now be used simply by importing a script located in `include`.

:::

## Step 7: Create a DAG with your custom operator

1. In the `plugin_test_dag.py` file import the `CatHttpOperator` by adding the following import statement at the start of the code:

    ```python
    from include.cat_http import CatHttpOperator
    ```

2. Create a second task in the existing DAG context using the new operator with the code snippet below.

    ```python
    call_api_cat = CatHttpOperator(
        task_id="call_api_cat",
        http_conn_id="random_user_api_conn",
        method="GET"
    )
    ```

This task will post the same GET request to the API you defined with the connection ID `randomuser_api` as the first task, but this time using the `CatHttpOperator`.

## Step 8: Run your DAG and view modified XComs

1. Run the `plugins_test_dag`, which now consists of two tasks. 

2. Select the latest run of the `call_api_cat` task in the Grid view and click on the **XCom** tab to view XComs returned by this task.

    ![XCom tab](/img/guides/extra_links_tutorial_xcom_tab.png)

3. Verify that the XCom for this task instance contains an entry for `status_code`. In the screenshot below the HTTP status code returned was 200.

    ![HTTP status code returned](/img/guides/extra_links_tutorial_http_code.png)

## Step 9: Add a dynamic extra link to your custom operator

Next, you will create a dynamic extra link using an Airflow plugin by following these steps:

1. Open `my_extra_link_plugin.py` in your `plugins` folder.

2. Add the following import statements at the start of the file:

    ```python
    from include.cat_http import CatHttpOperator
    from airflow.models import XCom
    ```

3. Copy paste the following code which creates a class called `CatLink` derived from `BaseOperatorLink` and paste it below the definition of the `HTTPDocsLink` class and above the definition of the `AirflowExtraLinkPlugin` class.

    ```python
    class CatLink(BaseOperatorLink):
        # name the link button in the UI
        name = "HTTP cat"

        # add the button to one or more operators
        operators = [CatHttpOperator]

        # provide the link
        def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key=None):
            status_code = XCom.get_value(key="status_code", ti_key=ti_key) or ""
            return f"https://http.cat/{status_code}"
    ```

    The code in the `.get_link()` method retrieves the `status_code` you pushed to XCom and appends it to the [HTTP cat Api link](https://http.cat/).

4. Update the `operator_extra_links` list in the `AirflowExtraLinkPlugin` class with the new `CatLink()`. The class should look like this:

    ```python
    class AirflowExtraLinkPlugin(AirflowPlugin):
        name = "extra_link_plugin"
        operator_extra_links = [
            CatLink(), # add this line
            HTTPDocsLink()
        ]
    ```

5. Save the file and restart your Airflow instance with `astro dev restart`.

:::tip

If you want to add an operator extra link to a custom operator as part of a provider package, make sure you install it with the rest of the package using a setup.py file or `wheels`. You can learn more in the official Airflow documentation under [How to create your own provider](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/#how-to-create-your-own-provider). 

:::

## Step 10: See your new extra link in action

Your second extra link has now been added to the CatHttpOperator.

1. In the Airflow UI, run `plugins_test_dag` again. 

2. Navigate to the Graph View and click on the `call_api_cat` task. 

3. Click the HTTP Cat button to find the response of your last API call illustrated with a fitting cat.

    ![Cat Button](/img/guides/extra_links_tutorial_cat_button.png)

4. (Optional) See all your plugins listed under **Admin** -> **Plugins**.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You added two operator extra links as an Airflow plugin. On the way you also learned how to modify an existing operator to pass an additional value to XCom.
