 This guide will help you get started with Astro, a fully managed Airflow service. 

## Activate your trial

Visit `cloud.astronomer.io/onboarding` to activate your 14 day trial. To create your Astro user account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and create a password.

## Create an Organization and Workspace

After you've created your Astro user account, you'll be asked to create an Organization and your first Workspace. 

An **Organization** is the highest Astro management level. All Airflow environments belong to a single Organization. An Organization contains **Workspaces**, which are collections of Airflow environments that are typically owned by a single team. 

During your trial, you can use any name for your Organization and first Workspace. You can update these names in the Cloud UI after you finish activating your trial. If you're going to migrate your data pipelines to Astro immediately, Astronomer recommends naming your Workspace after your data team or core function.

## Create an Astro cloud account and cluster

To run Airflow on your cloud, you'll need to set up an Astro cluster. An Astro cluster contains all of the components you need to create and run multiple Airflow environments at scale. Additionally, you'll need a dedicated account on your cloud that Astronomer can access. This account allows Astronomer to provision and manage your cluster resources. 

After you've created your Organization and Workspace, your new Workspace homepage appears. Click **Create Cluster** and then complete the setup for your cloud provider.

    values={[
        {label: 'AWS', value: 'aws'},
        {label: 'GCP', value: 'gcp'},
        {label: 'Azure', value: 'azure'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="aws">

1. Create a dedicated [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) for Astro. Astro uses this account to provision and manage your cluster resources. For security reasons, the install process is not currently supported on an AWS account that has other tooling running in it. 

2. Copy the Account ID for Step 3.

    When creating your account, specify the following [EC2 service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html):
    
    | QuotaCode  | QuotaName                                                        | Minimum Value  |
    | -----------| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------|
    | L-1216C47A | Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances | 40             |
    | L-34B43A08 | All Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Spot Instance Requests  | 40             |
    
    These quotas ensure a smooth onboarding experience on Astro. If you need to modify or increase a specific quota, see Amazonâ€™s documentation on [requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html).

3. On the Astro cluster creation screen, click **Launch AWS stack creation**. 
   
4. In AWS CloudFormation, enter your Astro AWS account ID in **AstroAccountId**.
   
5. Click **Create stack**. A cross-account Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is created to provide Astronomer support with administrator access to the Astro AWS account.
   
6. In the Cloud UI cluster creation screen, enter your Astro AWS account ID in **AWS Account ID**.
   
7. In the **Region** list , select the region where your cluster will be hosted. For trials, Astronomer recommends choosing the region that's closest to you.
   
8. Optional. Click **Advanced** and configure a VPC subnet range for Astro to connect to your AWS account through VPC peering. 
   
9. Click **Create cluster**. 
   
10. Wait for Astronomer to finish creating the cluster. You'll receive an email notification when the process is complete. 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gcp">

1. Create a dedicated [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) for Astro with billing enabled. Astro uses this account to provision and manage your cluster resources. For security reasons, the install process is not currently supported on a Google Cloud project that has other tooling running in it. 

2. Copy the project ID for step 4.
   
3. In the Cloud UI, click **Launch Google Cloud Shell** on the cluster creation screen.
   
4. In your cloud shell, run `/bootstrap.sh` and follow the steps to grant Astro access to your GCP project. 
   
5. In the Cloud UI cluster creation screen, enter your GCP Project ID in **GCP Project ID**.
   
6. In the **Region** list, select the region where you want to host your cluster. For trials, Astronomer recommends choosing the region that's closest to you.
   
7. Optional. Click **Advanced** and configure VPC subnet ranges for Astro to connect to your GCP project through VPC peering. 
   
8. Click **Create cluster**. 
   
9. Wait for Astronomer to finish creating the cluster. You'll receive an email notification when the process is complete.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="azure">

1. Create a dedicated [Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav/how-to--sign-up-for-a-microsoft-azure-subscription) for Astro. Astro uses this account to provision and manage your cluster resources. The subscription must be included in an Azure management group that doesn't apply Azure policies. See [What are Azure management groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview).

2. Copy the subscription ID for step 5.

3. In the Azure portal for your subscription, find and copy your [Azure Tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant#find-tenant-id-through-the-azure-portal) for step 5.

4. Grant Astronomer access to your Azure subscription through either the Azure CLI or Powershell.

## Deploy DAGs to Astro 

After Astronomer creates your cluster, you're ready to start deploying and running DAGs on Astro. Complete the following tasks to get your first DAG up and running on Astro: 

1. [Install the Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md). The Astro CLI is Astronomer's command line interface for testing Airflow both locally and on Astro.
2. [Create an Astro project](create-project.md). An Astro project contains all of the files you need to run Airflow, including example DAGs.
3. [Create a Deployment](create-deployment.md). A Deployment is Astronomer's mechanism for managing an Airflow deployment in your cluster.
4. [Deploy your Astro project](deploy-code.md). Use the Astro CLI to deploy code in just a few minutes. 

## Next steps

After you've become more familiar with deploying code to Astro, see the following documentation for more information about Astro features and tools:

- [Astro Cloud IDE quickstart](cloud-ide/quickstart.md): Learn how to use Astro's IDE to write data pipelines directly in the Cloud UI. For a more advanced introduction, see the [Write and schedule a simple ML pipeline using the Astro Cloud IDE](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/cloud-ide-tutorial).
- [Set up CI/CD](set-up-ci-cd.md): Learn how you can use the Astro CLI to automate code deploys to Astro. 
- [Manage environment variables](environment-variables.md): Use the Cloud UI to set both OS-level configurations and Airflow variables on your Deployment.
