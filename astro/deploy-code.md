This guide explains how to push Astro project code to a Deployment via the Astro CLI. This workflow is the foundation for managing changes to your deployed Astro projects. It also serves as the foundation for any [CI/CD](ci-cd.md) pipeline-based deployment model.

## Prerequisites

To deploy DAGs to Astro, you must have:

- The [Astro CLI](cli/get-started.md) installed in an empty directory.
- An Astro Workspace with at least one [Deployment](create-deployment.md).
- An [Astro project](create-project.md).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Step 1: Authenticate to Astro

Once you've tested your DAGs locally, you're ready to push them to Astro. To start, authenticate via the Astro CLI by running:

```
astro login
```

After running this command, you will be prompted to open your web browser and log in via the Cloud UI. Once you complete this login, you will be automatically authenticated to the CLI.

:::tip

If you have [Deployment API key](api-keys.md) credentials set as OS-level environment variables on your local machine, you can deploy directly to Astro without needing to manually authenticate. This setup is required for automating code deploys via [CI/CD](ci-cd.md).

## Step 2: Push DAGs to an Astro Deployment

To deploy your DAGs, run:

```
astro deploy
```

This command returns a list of Deployments available in your Workspace and prompts you to pick one.

After you select a Deployment, the CLI parses your DAGs to ensure that they don't contain basic syntax and import errors. This test is equivalent to the one that runs during `astro dev parse` in a local Airflow environment. If any of your DAGs fail this parse, the deploy to Astro will also fail.

If your code passes the parse, the CLI builds your Astro project directory into a new Docker image pushes this image to Astro.

:::tip

To force a deploy even if your project has DAG errors, you can run `astro deploy --force`.

:::tip

To validate your code before deploying it to Astro, you can run `astro deploy --pytest`. Adding the `--pytest` flag makes the CLI run all tests in your project's `tests` directory using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/contents.html). If any of these tests fail, your code deploy will also fail. This can help you prevent your team from deploying DAGs to Astro that aren't production-grade.

For more information about using Pytest, see [Test and troubleshoot locally](test-and-troubleshoot-locally.md#test-dags-locally-with-pytest).

## Step 3: Validate your changes

If it's your first time deploying, you'll need to wait a few minutes for the Docker image to build. The Docker image that is running on the Airflow webserver of your Deployment is shown in a tag in the Airflow UI footer. Depending on how your organization deploys to Astro, this tag is either a unique identifier generated by a Continuous Integration (CI) tool or a timestamp generated by the Astro CLI on astro deploy. Both represent a unique version of your Astro project.

1. In the Cloud UI, select a Workspace and then select a Deployment.
2. Click **Open Airflow**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view Docker image information in the footer:

## What happens during a code deploy

When you deploy code to Astro, your Astro project is built into a Docker image. This includes system-level dependencies, Python-level dependencies, DAGs, and your `Dockerfile`. It does not include any of the metadata associated with your local Airflow environment, including task history and Airflow connections or variables that were set locally. This Docker image is then pushed to all containers running the Apache Airflow application on Astro.

With the exception of the Airflow webserver and some Celery workers, Kubernetes gracefully terminates all containers during this process. This forces them to restart and begin running your latest code.

If you deploy code to a Deployment that is running a previous version of your code, then the following happens:

1. Tasks that are `running` will continue to execute on existing Celery workers and will not be interrupted unless the task does not complete within 24 hours of the code deploy.
2. One or more new worker(s) will spin up alongside your existing workers and immediately start executing scheduled tasks based on your latest code.

    These new workers will execute downstream tasks of DAG runs that are in progress. For example, if you deploy to Astronomer when `Task A` of your DAG is running, `Task A` will continue to run on an old Celery worker. If `Task B` and `Task C` are downstream of `Task A`, they will both be scheduled on new Celery workers running your latest code.

    This means that DAG runs could fail due to downstream tasks running code from a different source than their upstream tasks. DAG runs that fail this way need to be fully restarted from the Airflow UI so that all tasks are executed based on the same source code.

Astronomer sets a grace period of 24 hours for all workers to allow running tasks to continue executing. This grace period is not configurable. If a task does not complete within 24 hours, its worker will be terminated. Airflow will mark the task as a [zombie](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html#zombie-undead-tasks) and it will retry according to the task's retry policy. This is to ensure that our team can reliably upgrade and maintain Astro as a service.

:::tip

If you want to force long-running tasks to terminate sooner than 24 hours, specify an [`execution_timeout`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html#timeouts) in your DAG's task definition.
