## Description

Generate completion scripts for Astro CLI commands. You can modify the generated scripts and add them to the appropriate directory to customize your command line autocompletion behavior.

For example, you could set automation such that typing `astrocloud au` autocompletes to `astrocloud auth` if you press **TAB** on your keyboard and `astrocloud auth login` or `astrocloud auth logout` if you press **TAB** again.

This command is helpful for users interacting with the CLI on a regular basis.

## Usage

```sh
astrocloud completion <shell>
```

## Options

| Option  | Description                                          | Possible Values                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<shell>` | The type of shell to generate completion scripts for | `bash`,`fish`, `powershell`,`zsh` |

## Example

To generate a shell completion script for zsh, for example, you can run:

```sh
$ astrocloud completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_astrocloud
# Completion script saved in your local directory
```

Then, to enable autocompletion, ensure that the following lines are present in your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
autoload -U compinit
compinit -i
```
