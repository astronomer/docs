## Description

[Deploy code](deploy-code.md) to a Deployment on Astro.

This command bundles all files in your Astro project and pushes them to Astro. Before completing the process, it tests your DAGs in your Astro project for errors. If this test fails, the deploy to Astro will also fail. This is the same test which runs locally with `astrocloud dev parse`.

When you run `astrocloud deploy`, you'll be prompted to select from a list of all Deployments that you have access to across Workspaces. To bypass this prompt, you can also specify a Deployment ID in the command. To retrieve a Deployment ID, go to your Deployment's information page in the Cloud UI and copy the value after the last `/` in the URL. You can also find a Deployment's ID by running `astrocloud deployment list`.

For teams operating at scale, this command can be automated via a [CI/CD pipeline](ci-cd.md) by using [Deployment API keys](api-keys.md) in the request. When `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` and `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` are specified as OS-level environment variables on your local machine or in a CI tool, `astrocloud deploy <deployment-id>` can be run without requiring user authentication.

## Usage

```sh
astrocloud deploy <options>
```

$ astrocloud deploy

# Deploy directly to a specific Deployment

# Running `astrocloud deploy` will now automatically select this Deployment for your Astro project
$ astrocloud deploy ckvvfp9tf509941drl4vela81n --save
