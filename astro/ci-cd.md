description: Create a CI/CD pipeline that triggers a deploy to Astro based on changes to your Airflow DAGs.
---

## Overview

There are many benefits to deploying DAGs and other changes to Airflow via a CI/CD workflow. Specifically, you can:

- Deploy new and updated DAGs in a way that streamlines the development process amongst team members.
- Decrease the maintenance cost of integrating changes, allowing your team to quickly respond in case of an error or failure.
- Enforce continuous, automating testing, which increases code quality and protects your DAGs in production.

This guide provides setup steps for configuring a CI/CD pipeline to deploy DAGs on Astro.

## Prerequisites

To set up CI/CD for a given Deployment, you need:

- A [Deployment API key ID and secret](api-keys.md)
- A Deployment ID. To find this, open your Deployment in the Cloud UI and copy the unique string at the end of the URL. For example, `cktogz2eg847343yzo9pru1b0d` is the Deployment ID in `https://cloud.astronomer.io/<workspace-ID>/deployments/cktogz2eg847343yzo9pru1b0d`. You can also find this value by running `astrocloud deployment list` via the Astro CLI.
- A CI/CD management tool, such as [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
- An [Astro project](create-project.md) that is hosted in a place that your CI/CD tool can access.

## CI/CD Templates

The following section provides basic templates for configuring individual CI pipelines using popular CI/CD tools. Each template can be implemented as-is to produce a simple CI/CD pipeline, but we recommend reconfiguring the templates to work with your own directory structures, workflows, and best practices. More templates are coming soon.

At a high level, these CI/CD pipelines will:

1. Access Deployment API key credentials. These credentials must be set as OS-level environment variables called `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` and `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`.
2. Install the latest version of the Astro CLI.
3. Run `astrocloud deploy`. This builds your Astro project into a Docker image, authenticates to Astro using your Deployment API key, and pushes the image to your Deployment.

This workflow is equivalent to the following bash script:

```sh
# Set Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
$ export ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID="<your-api-key-id>"
$ export ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET="<your-api-key-secret>"

# Install the Astro CLI
$ brew install astronomer/cloud/astrocloud@1.2.0

# Build your Astro project into a Docker image and push the image to your Deployment
$ astrocloud deploy <your-deployment-id>
```

:::info

The following templates use `brew install` to install the latest version of the Astro CLI for every deploy. For a more stable CI/CD pipeline, you can install only a specific version of the CLI by tagging a specific version in the command: 

```sh
brew install astronomer/cloud/astrocloud@<version-number>
```

### GitHub Actions

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-key-id>`
   - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-key-secret>`
   - `DEPLOYMENT_ID` = `<your-astro-deployment-id>`

2. Create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy Code

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Sets Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
      ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID }}
      ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET }}

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            brew install astronomer/cloud/astrocloud
            astrocloud deploy ${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_ID }}
    ```


### Jenkins

To automate code deploys to a single Deployment using [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository hosting an Astronomer project:

1. In your Git repository, configure the following environment variables:

    - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID`: Your Deployment API key ID
    - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`: Your Deployment API key secret

    Be sure to set the values for your API credentials as secret.

2. At the root of your Git repository, add a [Jenkinsfile](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/) that includes the following script, making sure to replace `<deployment-id>` with your own Deployment ID:

    ```text
    pipeline {
     agent any
       stages {
         stage('Deploy to Astronomer') {
           when {
            expression {
              return env.GIT_BRANCH == "origin/main"
            }
           }
           steps {
             script {
               brew install astronomer/cloud/astrocloud
               astrocloud deploy <deployment-id>
             }
           }
         }
       }
     post {
       always {
         cleanWs()
       }
     }
    }
    ```

    This Jenkinsfile triggers a code push to Astro every time a commit or pull request is merged to the `main` branch of your repository.
