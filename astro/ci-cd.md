Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is an industry term that refers to programmatic workflows that automate key parts of the software development lifecycle, including code changes, builds, and testing. CI/CD enables teams to develop faster, more securely, and more reliably.

On Astro, you can use Deployment API keys to automate deploying code changes to a Deployment. Astronomer recommends setting up a CI/CD workflow for all production environments.

You can use the Astronomer CI/CD templates with popular CI/CD management tools, including GitHub Actions and Circle CI.

There are many benefits to configuring a CI/CD workflow that automates pushing code changes to Astro. Specifically, you can:

- Deploy new and updated DAGs in a way that streamlines your development process.
- Decrease the maintenance cost of integrating changes, allowing your team to quickly respond in case of an error or failure.
- Enforce continuous, automating testing, which increases code quality and protects your DAGs in production.

## Prerequisites

- A [Deployment API key ID and secret](api-keys.md)
- A CI/CD management tool, such as [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
- An [Astro project](create-project.md) that is hosted in a place that your CI/CD tool can access.

## CI/CD templates

Templates allow you to quickly configure individual CI pipelines using popular CI/CD tools. Each template can be implemented as-is to produce a simple CI/CD pipeline. Astronomer recommends reconfiguring the templates to work with your own directory structures, workflows, and best practices.

Astro supports two deployment methods: project deploys and DAG-only deploys. This document contains two kinds of templates that utilize these deployment methods in different ways: One-step templates and multi-step templates.

### One-step templates

One-step templates deploy your project as a Docker image whenever your update your project. This type of template is simple to set up and works well for development workflows.

With a one-step CI/CD template, your CI/CD tool will:

- Access Deployment API key credentials. These credentials must be set as OS-level environment variables named `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` and `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`.
- Install the latest version of the Astro CLI.
- Run `astro deploy`. This creates a Docker image for your Astro project, authenticates to Astro using your Deployment API key, and pushes the image to your Deployment.

This workflow is equivalent to the following bash script:

```sh
# Set Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
$ export ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID="<your-api-key-id>"
$ export ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET="<your-api-key-secret>"

# Install the latest version of Astro CLI
$ curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s

# Build your Astro project into a Docker image and push the image to your Deployment
$ astro deploy
```

:::info

The following templates use [Astro CLI v1.0+](cli/release-notes.md) to deploy via CI/CD. These templates will not work if you use the `astrocloud` executable. To upgrade, see [Install the Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

:::

### Multi-step templates

A multi-step workflow utilizes the `--dags` CLI flag to improve the performance of your CI/CD workflows. These CI/CD pipelines deploy your DAGs only when files in your `dags` folder are modified, and they deploy your entire Astro project as an image when any other files or directories are modified. 

This workflow has a number of benefits: 

- Your Deployment's infrastructure will not experience downtime for updates to DAG code.
- DAG only deploys are faster than image deploys. Your code changes will appear in Airflow faster than for project configuration changes
- You can have different sets of users deploy project changes and DAG changes.

Specifically, a multi-step CI/CD template:

- Accesses Deployment API key credentials. These credentials must be set as OS-level environment variables named `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` and `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`.
- Installs the latest version of the Astro CLI.
- Determines which files were updated by the commit:
    - If only DAG files in the `dags` folder have changed, run `astro deploy --dags`. This pushes your `dags` folder to your Deployment
    - If any file not in the `dags` folder has changed, run `astro deploy`. This creates a Docker image for your Astro project, authenticates to Astro using your Deployment API key, and pushes the image and DAGs to your Deployment.

This workflow is equivalent to the following bash script:

```sh
# Set Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
export ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID="<your-api-key-id>"
export ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET="<your-api-key-secret>"

# Install the latest version of Astro CLI
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s

# Determine if only dags have changes 
OUTPUT=$(git diff main... --name-only)
DAGS_DEPLOY=FALSE
REGULAR_DEPLOY=FALSE
local IFS=$'\n'
local lines=($OUTPUT)
local i
for (( i=0; i<${#lines[@]}; i++ )) ; do
    if [[ "${lines[$i]}" == *"dags/"* ]]
    then
        DAGS_DEPLOY=TRUE
    else
        REGULAR_DEPLOY=TRUE
    fi
done

# If only DAGs changed deploy only the DAGs in your 'dags' folder to your Deployment
if [ $DAGS_DEPLOY == TRUE && $REGULAR_DEPLOY == FALSE ]
then
    astro deploy --dags
fi

# If any other files changed build your Astro project into a Docker image, push the image to your Deployment, and then push and DAG changes
if [ $REGULAR_DEPLOY == TRUE ]
then
    astro deploy
fi
```

Make sure to update the `git diff` command to reflect your use case. For example you may want to compare your a feature branch to your main branch.

:::info

The following templates use [Astro CLI v1.7+](cli/release-notes.md) to deploy via CI/CD. To upgrade, see [Install the Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

### GitHub Actions (One-step)

<Tabs
    defaultValue="standard"
    groupId= "github-actions"
    values={[
        {label: 'Standard', value: 'standard'},
        {label: 'Multi-branch', value: 'multibranch'},
        {label: 'Custom Image', value: 'custom'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="standard">

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-key-id>`
   - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-key-secret>`

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Sets Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
      ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID }}
      ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET }}

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="multibranch">

The following setup can be used to create a multi-branch CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. A multi-branch pipeline makes can be used to test DAGs in a development Deployment and promote them to a production Deployment. The finished pipeline would deploy your code to Astro as demonstrated in the following diagram:

![Diagram showing how a multibranch CI/CD pipeline works](/img/docs/multibranch.png)

This setup assumes the following prerequisites:

- You have both a `dev` and `main` branch of an Astro project hosted in a single GitHub repository.
- You have respective `dev` and `prod` Deployments on Astro where you deploy your GitHub branches to.
- You have unique [Deployment API keys and secrets](api-keys.md) for both of your Deployments.

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   - `PROD_ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-prod-key-id>`
   - `PROD_ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-prod-key-secret>`
   - `DEV_ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-dev-key-id>`
   - `DEV_ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-dev-key-secret>`

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code (Multiple Branches)

    on:
      push:
        branches: [dev]
      pull_request:
        types:
          - closed
        branches: [main]

    jobs:
      dev-push:
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/dev'
        env:
          ## Sets DEV Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.DEV_ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID }}
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.DEV_ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy
      prod-push:
        if: github.event.action == 'closed' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true
        env:
          ## Sets PROD Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.PROD_ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID }}
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.PROD_ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="custom">

If your Astro project requires additional build-time arguments to build an image, you need to define these build arguments using Docker's [`build-push-action`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action).

#### Prerequisites

To complete this setup, you need:

- An Astro project that requires additional build-time arguments to build the Runtime image.

#### Setup

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

  - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-key-id>`
  - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-key-secret>`

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Additional build-time args

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_ACCESS_KEY_ID_DEV }}
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_DEV }}
        steps:
        - name: Check out the repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Create image tag
          id: image_tag
          run: echo ::set-output name=image_tag::astro-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
        - name: Build image
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
          with:
            tags: ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
            load: true
            # Define your custom image's build arguments, contexts, and connections here using
            # the available GitHub Action settings:
            # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action#customizing .
            # This example uses `build-args` , but your use case might require configuring
            # different values.
            build-args: |
              <your-build-arguments>
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy --image-name ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
    ```

    For example, to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a project which [installs Python packages from a private GitHub repository](develop-project.md#install-python-packages-from-private-sources), you would use the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Custom base image

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_ACCESS_KEY_ID_DEV }}
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_DEV }}
        steps:
        - name: Check out the repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Create image tag
          id: image_tag
          run: echo ::set-output name=image_tag::astro-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
        - name: Create SSH Socket
          uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4
          with:
            # GITHUB_SSH_KEY must be defined as a GitHub secret.
            ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_SSH_KEY }}
        - name: (Optional) Test SSH Connection - Should print hello message.
          run: (ssh git@github.com) || true
        - name: Build image
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v2

            load: true
            ssh: |
              github=${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy --image-name ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}

If your Astro project requires additional build-time arguments to build an image, you need to define these build arguments using Docker's [`build-push-action`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action).

#### Prerequisites

To complete this setup, you need:

- An Astro project that requires additional build-time arguments to build the Runtime image.

#### Setup

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

  - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-key-id>`
  - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-key-secret>`

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Additional build-time args
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_ACCESS_KEY_ID_DEV }}
          ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_DEV }}
        steps:
        - name: Check out the repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
          with:
            # Checkout as many commits as needed for the diff
            fetch-depth: 2
        # Determine if only dags have changes 
        - name: Get Deployment Type

### Bitbucket

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

1. Set the following environment variables as [Bitbucket pipeline variables](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/variables-and-secrets/):

    - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-key-id>`
    - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-key-secret>`

2. Create a new YAML file in `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` at the root of the repository that includes the following configuration:

    <pre><code parentName="pre">{`
    pipelines:
      pull-requests: # The branch pattern under pull requests defines the *source* branch.
        dev:
          - step:
              name: Deploy to Production
              deployment: Production
              script:
                - curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
                - astro deploy
              services:
                - docker
    `}</code></pre>


### Azure DevOps

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

1. Set the following environment variables as [DevOps pipeline variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch):

    - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` = `<your-key-id>`
    - `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` = `<your-key-secret>`

2. Create a new YAML file in `astro-devops-cicd.yaml` at the root of the repository that includes the following configuration:

    <pre><code parentName="pre">{`
    trigger:
    - main

    pr: none

    stages:
    - stage: deploy
      jobs:
      - job: deploy_image
        pool:
          vmImage: 'Ubuntu-latest'
        steps:
        - script: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy
          env:
            ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID: $(ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID)
            ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET: $(ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET)
    `}</code></pre>

## Use CI/CD for DAG-only deploys

A DAG-only deploy workflow utilizes the `--dags` CLI flag to improve the performance of your CI/CD workflows. These CI/CD pipelines deploy your DAGs only when files in your `dags` folder are modified, and they deploy your entire Astro project as an image when any other files or directories are modified. 

This workflow has a number of benefits: 

- Your Deployment's infrastructure will not experience downtime for updates to DAG code.
- DAG only deploys are faster than image deploys. Your code changes will appear in Airflow faster than for project configuration changes
- You can have different sets of users deploy project changes and DAG changes.

The DAG Deploy CI/CD template workflow:

- Accesses Deployment API key credentials. These credentials must be set as OS-level environment variables named `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` and `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`.
- Installs the latest version of the Astro CLI.
- Determines which files were updated by the commit:
    - If only DAG files in the `dags` folder have changed, run `astro deploy --dags`. This pushes your `dags` folder to your Deployment
    - If any file not in the `dags` folder has changed, run `astro deploy`. This creates a Docker image for your Astro project, authenticates to Astro using your Deployment API key, and pushes the image and DAGs to your Deployment.

This workflow is equivalent to the following bash script:

```sh
# Set Deployment API key credentials as environment variables
export ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID="<your-api-key-id>"
export ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET="<your-api-key-secret>"

# Install the latest version of Astro CLI
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s

# Determine if only dags have changes 
OUTPUT=$(git diff main... --name-only)
DAGS_DEPLOY=FALSE
REGULAR_DEPLOY=FALSE
local IFS=$'\n'
local lines=($OUTPUT)
local i
for (( i=0; i<${#lines[@]}; i++ )) ; do
    if [[ "${lines[$i]}" == *"dags/"* ]]
    then
        DAGS_DEPLOY=TRUE
    else
        REGULAR_DEPLOY=TRUE
    fi
done

# If only DAGs changed deploy only the DAGs in your 'dags' folder to your Deployment
if [ $DAGS_DEPLOY == TRUE && $REGULAR_DEPLOY == FALSE ]
then
    astro deploy --dags
fi

# If any other files changed build your Astro project into a Docker image, push the image to your Deployment, and then push and DAG changes
if [ $REGULAR_DEPLOY == TRUE ]
then
    astro deploy
fi
```

Make sure to update the `git diff` command to reflect your use case. For example you may want to compare your a feature branch to your main branch.

:::info

The following templates use [Astro CLI v1.7+](cli/release-notes.md) to deploy via CI/CD. To upgrade, see [Install the Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).
