On Astro, you have options when it comes to organizing your code repository and setting up CI/CD. It's important to keep in mind the benefits and limitations of each option, along with the needs of your team and structure of your organization, when adopting a deployment and CI/CD strategy.

## Feature overview

Astro supports a variety of deployment and CI/CD strategies. For example, you can keep your DAG code and your project configuration in separate repositories, and you can deploy from multiple repositories to a single Astro Deployment. But each approach Astro supports has drawbacks depending on your team's needs and other factors. The guidance offered here is intended to help you choose the best deployment and CI/CD strategy for your team. 

## Best practice guidance

### Option 1: one repo to one Deployment

### Option 2: one repo with multiple projects to multiple Deployments with CI/CD

### Option 3: multiple repos to one Deployment
