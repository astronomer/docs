1. Run the following command to authenticate to Astro:

    ```sh
    astro login
    ```

2. Run the following command to deploy your project

    ```sh
    astro deploy
    ```

    This command returns a list of Deployments available in your Workspace and prompts you to pick one.

    After you select a Deployment, the CLI parses your DAGs to check for basic syntax and import errors. This test is equivalent to the one that runs during `astro dev parse` in a local Airflow environment. If any of your DAGs fail this parse, the deploy to Astro also fails.

    If your code passes the parse, the Astro CLI builds all files in your Astro project directory into a new Docker image and then pushes the image to your Deployment on Astro.

3. In the Cloud UI, open your Deployment and click **Open Airflow**. Confirm that you can see your deployed DAGs in the Airflow UI.
