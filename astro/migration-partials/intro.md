This process only supports **Airflow 2.x**. Your source Airflow environment will need to be upgraded prior to migration
if they are **Airflow 1.x**, and Astronomer Professional services can help you with that process.

To complete the migration process, you will:

- **Prepare** your source Airflow and **set up** your Astro Airflow
- **Migrate Metadata** from your source Airflow environment
- **Migrate DAGs** and additional Airflow components
- Complete the **Cutover process**
