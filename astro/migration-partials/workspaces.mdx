Astro has Workspaces - which are collections of Airflow Deployments that can be accessed by a specific group of users.

Follow the [Manage Workspaces](manage-workspaces.md) documentation to create a workspace in the Astro UI to hold your migrated Airflow Deployments.

Afterwards, add users to your new Workspace by referring to [Manage Astro users](add-user.md).
More details on user permissions can be found at [Manage Astro user permissions](user-permissions.md)
