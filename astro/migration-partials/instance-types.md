You may find yourself needing to adjust instance types from the original that were set, which you can read about in the [Manage Worker Types](modify-cluster.md#manage-worker-types) documentation.
You can additionally use [Worker Queues](configure-worker-queues.md) to set different instance types for specific tasks to run on.
Use the `Analytics` tab to help you determine changes that may be required.
