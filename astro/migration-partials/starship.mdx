To complete this step, install the Starship migration utility to your source Airflow environment.

The [Astronomer Starship](https://pypi.org/project/astronomer-starship/) migration utility will assist you by connecting to both your source
and Astro Airflow deployment to migrate Airflow Connections, Variables, and assist in migrating your DAGs between instances.

The Starship migration utility can either function as a
[plugin](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/tree/master/astronomer-starship) with a user interface,
or an Airflow operator if you are migrating from a more restricted Airflow environment.
