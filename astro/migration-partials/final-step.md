Now that our deployment is successfully in Astro Cloud, we can complete the migration by fully shifting off the source Airflow to our Astro Airflow.

We will do this DAG-by-DAG, depending on how your workloads are set up it will be best for the owners or authors of the DAGs to determine in what order to migrate and test them.

You can do this offline and provide updates to your Astronomer Data Engineer, as they continue to assist you through the process and any difficulties that are encountered.
