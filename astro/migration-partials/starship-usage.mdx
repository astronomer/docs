Airflow can get Connections and Variables from multiple sources:

- The Airflow UI (stored in the Airflow Metadata Database)
- Environmental Variables
- A Secrets Backend

If your Airflow contains connections or variables in the Metadata Database, which you can observe in `Admin > Connections` (or `Admin > Variables`), you can
migrate those to Astro with Starship.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="plugin" label="Starship Plugin" default>

1. Once your source environment installs `astronomer-starship` via the `requirements.txt`, you will see a new Astronomer menu. Hover over that menu and select the `Migration Tool üöÄ` option
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/menu-item.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/menu-item.png)

2. After opening the plugin page, you will need to authenticate to Astronomer. To do this, please:
    1. Click the `Get Token` button
    2. If you are prompted to sign-in to cloud.astronomer.io please do so
    3. Copy the access token that appears in the new tab
    4. Paste the access token into the `Authentication Token` field
    5. Click the `Sign In` button

3. After authenticating to Astronomer, you will need to select the deployment that you are sending metadata to. To do this, select a deployment from the `Target Deployment` dropdown and click the `Select` button

To migrate connections from your source Airflow meta-database:

1. Click on the `Connections` tab:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/connections-tab.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/connections-tab.png)

2. In the table displaying the connections that can be migrated, click the `Migrate` button for each connection that needs to be sent to the Target Deployment:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/connections-migrate.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/connections-migrate.png)

3. Once the `Migrate` button is clicked, the connection will be sent to the Target Deployment and will show as `Migrated ‚úÖ` in the plugin UI:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/connections-migrate-complete.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/connections-migrate-complete.png)

#### Migrating Airflow Variables

To migrate variables from your source Airflow meta-database:

1. Click on the `Variables` tab:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/variables-tab.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/variables-tab.png)

2. In the table displaying the variables that can be migrated, click the `Migrate` button for each connection that needs to be sent to the Target Deployment
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/variables-migrate.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/variables-migrate.png)

3. Once the `Migrate` button is clicked, the variable will be sent to the Target Deployment and will show as `Migrated ‚úÖ` in the plugin UI:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/variables-migrate-complete.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/variables-migrate-complete.png)

#### Migrating Environment Variables
:::caution
Not all Environmental Variables or Airflow Settings are [configurable on Astro](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/platform-variables)
:::

To migrate environment variables from your source Airflow:

1. Click on the `Environment Variables` tab:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-tab.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-tab.png)

2. In the table displaying the environment variables that can be migrated, ensure the checkbox is ticked for each environment variable that needs to be sent to the Target Deployment
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-migrate.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-migrate.png)

3. Once all of the desired environment variable checkboxes have been selected, click the `Migrate` button in the table header
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-migrate-button.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-migrate-button.png)

4. After clicking the `Migrate` button in the table header, each selected environment variable will be sent to the Target Deployment and the ticked checkbox will display `Migrated `‚úÖ
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-migrate-complete.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/env-migrate-complete.png)

#### Utilizing DAGs Cutover Tab
The DAGs Cutover Tab can be utilized to pause DAGs in the source environment and unpause DAGs in the target environment (as long as the DAG id in both the source and target environment match). To do so, please:

1. Click on the `DAGs Cutover` tab:
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-tab.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-tab.png)

2. In the table displaying the DAGs present in both the source and target environments, click the Pause icon under `Loca`l
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-pause-local.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-pause-local.png)

3. In the table displaying the DAGs present in both the source and target environments, click the Start icon under `Remot`e
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-start-remote.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-start-remote.png)

4. After completing this process, you will see the DAG is paused in the `Local` environment (so you will see a Start Icon) and is unpaused in the `Remote` environment (so you will see a Pause icon)
    ![https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-complete.png](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-complete.png)

<TabItem value="operator" label="Starship Operator">

:::info
Refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/tree/master/astronomer-starship-provider#configuration) instructions for the operator before running.
:::
:::caution
Not all Environmental Variables or Airflow Settings are [configurable on Astro](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/platform-variables)
:::

1. Add the following DAG to your source environment:
    ```python
    from airflow import DAG
    from astronomer.starship.operators import AstroMigrationOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    with DAG(
      dag_id="astronomer_migration_dag",
      start_date=datetime(1970, 1, 1),
      schedule_interval=None,
    ) as dag:
      AstroMigrationOperator(
          task_id='export_meta',
          deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
          token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
      )
    ```
2. Deploy this DAG to your source Airflow environment
3. Once the DAG is available in the Airflow UI, click the "Trigger DAG" ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button, then click "Trigger DAG w/ config", and input the following in the configuration dictionary:

    - `astro_token`:  To retrieve an Astronomer token, navigate to [cloud.astronomer.io/token](https://cloud.astronomer.io/token) and log in using your Astronomer credentials
    - `deployment_url`: To retrieve a deployment URL - navigate to the Astronomer Airlow deployment that you'd like to migrate to in the Astronomer UI, click `Open Airflow` and copy the page URL (excluding `/home` on the end of the URL). For example, if your deployment URL is `https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry/home`, you'll use `https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry`

    The config dictionary used when triggering the DAG should be formatted as:
    ```json
    {
        "deployment_url": "your-deployment-url",
        "astro_token": "your-astro-token"
    }
    ```
4. Once the DAG successfully runs, your connections, variables, and environment variables should all be migrated to Astronomer
