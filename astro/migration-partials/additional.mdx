At this point, you can create a new repository in your Source Control repository (e.g. GitHub) and push your new project up follow the instructions provided.

#### CI/CD
If a CI/CD pipeline is being used to manage the source Airflow, you can follow the instructions for your CI/CD provider with the [Set-Up CI/CD](set-up-ci-cd.md) documentation.

#### Secrets Backend
If a secrets backend is being used for Airflow Connections, Configurations, or Variables - you can follow the instructions to [Configure a Secrets Backend](secrets-backend.md).

Typically, this involves setting the environment keys `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND` and `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS`, which are frequently set in the `Dockerfile` or [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) in an Astro Project.
