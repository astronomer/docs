Depending on how thoroughly you want to test your Airflow environment, you have a few options for testing your project locally before deploying to Astro.

- In your Astro project directory, run `astro dev parse` to check for any parsing errors in your DAGs.
- Run `astro run <dag-id>` to test a specific DAG. This command compiles your DAG and runs it in a single Airflow worker container based on your Astro project configurations.
- Run `astro dev start` to start a complete Airflow environment on your local machine. After your project starts up, you can access the Airflow UI at `localhost:8080`. See [Test and troubleshoot locally](test-and-troubleshoot-locally.md).

Note that your migrated Airflow variables and connections are not available locally. You must deploy your project to Astro to test these resources.
