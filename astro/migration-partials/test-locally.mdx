After you have completed the set-up of your Astro Deployment, we can prepare to begin testing.

While you are still working locally, you can utilize `astro dev parse` to see if there are any parsing errors with your DAGs.

You can also run a specific DAG with `astro run ...` or run an entire Airflow stack locally with `astro dev start`.
