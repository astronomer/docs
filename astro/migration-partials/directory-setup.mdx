1. Create a new directory for your Astro project:

    ```sh
    mkdir <your-astro-project-name>
    ```

2. Open the directory:

    ```sh
    cd <your-astro-project-name>
    ```

3. Run the following Astro CLI command to initialize an Astro project in the directory:

    ```sh
    astro dev init
    ```

    This command generates a set of files that will build into a Docker image that you can both run on your local machine and deploy to Astro.

4. Optional. Run the following command to initialize a new git repository for your Astro project:

    ```sh
    git init
    ```
