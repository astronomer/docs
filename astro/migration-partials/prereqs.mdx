The migration process should be completed with assistance from your Astronomer Data Engineer. Before you meet with your Astronomer Data Engineer, ensure that the following steps are completed:

- Astronomer has [activated your installation](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/category/install-astro).
- You have [connected your cloud resources](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/category/connect-astro) to Astro.
- Optional. You have [configured your identity provider (IdP)](configure-idp.md).

On your local machine, make sure you have the following:

- An [Astro account](log-in-to-astro.md).
- The [Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

On the cloud service from which you're migrating, ensure that you have:

- A source Airflow environment on Airflow 2 or later.
- Read access to the source Airflow environment.
- Read access to the any cloud storage buckets that store your DAGs.
- Read access to any source control tool that hosts your current Airflow code, such as GitHub.
- Permission to create new repositories on your source control tool.
- Access to any secrets backend credentials.
- Optional. Permission to create new CI/CD pipelines.
