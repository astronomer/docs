description: Everything you need to know about Astronomerâ€™s modern data orchestration tool for the cloud, powered by Apache Airflow.
---

Astro is a managed software service that offers a next-generation experience for modern data teams running Apache Airflow, the open source industry standard for data orchestration.

Astro boasts a hybrid deployment model founded on a control plane hosted by Astronomer and a data plane that is hosted in your cloud environment. Both are fully managed by Astronomer. This model offers the self-service convenience of a fully managed service while respecting the need to keep data private, secure, and within corporate boundaries. This solution optimizes security and reduces operational overhead.

Beyond architecture, Astro offers a suite of first-class features that make it easy to author, run, and monitor data pipelines.

## Features

The key features of the Astro architecture include:

- Worker auto-scaling, powered by the Airflow Celery executor + KEDA.
- The ability to run multiple clusters in your organization's network on AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- Astro Runtime, a collection of Docker images that provides a differentiated data orchestration experience.
- Timely support for the latest major, minor, and patch versions of the Apache Airflow open source project.
- Support for role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) for secure user management and authentication.
- An observability experience that gives you insight into the health and resource consumption of your tasks and pipelines in real time.

## Architecture

The following diagram outlines how the control plane, data plane, and users are connected to enable these features:
