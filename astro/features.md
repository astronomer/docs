Astro offers a suite of first-class features that make it easy to author, run, and monitor Airflow DAGs.

## Feature list

- Worker auto-scaling, powered by the Airflow Celery executor and KEDA. See [Worker queues](configure-worker-queues.md).
- Astro Runtime, a collection of Docker images that provides a differentiated Airflow experience. See [Runtime image architecture](runtime-image-architecture.mdx).
- Timely support for the latest major, minor, and patch versions of the Apache Airflow open source project.
- A fully managed experience for using the Kubernetes executor and KubernetesPodOperator.
- Support for role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) for secure user management and authentication. See [Configure an identity provider (IdP)](configure-idp.md) and [User permissions](user-permissions.md).
- An observability experience that gives you data lineage across your ecosystem as well as real-time insight into the health and resource consumption of your data pipelines on Astro. See [Data lineage](data-lineage.md) and [Deployment metrics](deployment-metrics.md).
- A toolset for programmatically managing Airflow environments across teams and development cycles. See [CI/CD](ci-cd-templates/template-overview.md) and [Manage Deployments as code](manage-deployments-as-code.md).
