:::tip

The Astro GitHub integration can automatically deploy code from a GitHub repository to Astro without you needing to configure a GitHub action. In addition, the Astro UI shows Git metadata for each deploy on your Deployment information screen. See [Deploy code with the Astro GitHub integration](deploy-github-integration.md) for setup steps.

:::

If you don't have access to the Astronomer [deploy action](https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action) because you can't access the public internet from your GitHub repository, use one of the following private network templates to deploy to Astro.

Read the following sections to choose the right template for your use case. If you have one Deployment and one environment on Astro, use the _single branch implementation_. If you have multiple Deployments that support development and production environments, use the _multiple branch implementation_. If your team builds custom Docker images, use the _custom image_ implementation.

You can configure your CI/CD pipelines to deploy a full project image or your `dags` directory. To learn more about CI/CD on Astro, see [Choose a CI/CD strategy](set-up-ci-cd.md).

:::warning

If you use a [self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) to execute jobs from GitHub Actions, the Astro CLI's `config.yaml` file, which stores default deploy details, might be shared across your organization and hence multiple CI/CD pipelines. To reduce the risk of accidentally deploying to the wrong Deployment, ensure the following:

- Add `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` to your repository and include a check in your GitHub workflow to verify that it exists.
- Use Deployment API tokens, which are scoped only to one Deployment, instead of Workspace or Organization API tokens.
- Specify `deployment-id` or `deployment-name` in your action. For example, `astro deploy <deployment-id>` or `astro deploy -n <deployment-name>`.
- Add the command `astro logout` at the end of your workflow to ensure that your authentication token is cleared from the `config.yaml` file.

:::

## Prerequisites

- An [Astro project](cli/develop-project.md#create-an-astro-project) hosted in a GitHub repository.
- An [Astro Deployment](create-deployment.md).
- A [Deployment API token](deployment-api-tokens.md), [Workspace API token](workspace-api-tokens.md), or [Organization API token](organization-api-tokens.md).
- Access to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   - `ASTRO_API_TOKEN`: The value for your Workspace or Organization API token.

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration. When you make a commit to a specified branch, this workflow sets your Deployment API credentials as environment variables, installs the latest version of the Astro CLI, checks to see if your `dags` folder has changes, and then either completes a full code deploy or a DAG-only code deploy.

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Sets Deployment API credentials as environment variables
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest # add the appropriate image
        steps:
            # Install the Astro CLI (current version)
            - name: checkout repo
              uses: actions/checkout@v3
              with:
                fetch-depth: 2
                clean: false
            - name: Install the CLI
              run: curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            # Determine if only DAG files have changes
            - name: Deploy to Astronomer
              run: |
                files=$(git diff --name-only $(git rev-parse HEAD~1) -- .)
                dags_only=1
                for file in $files; do
                if [[ $file != dags/* ]]; then
                    echo "$file is not a dag, triggering a full image build"
                    dags_only=0
                    break
                fi
                done
                ### If only DAGs changed deploy only the DAGs in your 'dags' folder to your Deployment
                if [ $dags_only == 1 ]
                then
                    astro deploy --dags
                fi
                ### If any other files changed build your Astro project into a Docker image, push the image to your Deployment, and then push and DAG changes
                if [ $dags_only == 0 ]
                then
                    astro deploy
                fi
    ```

The following setup can be used to create a multiple branch CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to push a [full image deploy](deploy-project-image.md) to Astro. A multiple branch pipeline can be used to test DAGs in a development Deployment and promote them to a production Deployment.

#### Prerequisites

- You have both a `dev` and `main` branch of an Astro project hosted in a single GitHub repository.
- You have respective `dev` and `prod` Deployments on Astro where you deploy your GitHub branches to.
- You have at least one API token with access to both of your Deployments.

#### Setup

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   - `PROD_ASTRO_API_TOKEN`: The value for your production Workspace or Organization API token.
   - `DEV_ASTRO_API_TOKEN`: The value for your Workspace or Organization API token.

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code (Multiple Branches)

    on:
      push:
        branches: [dev]
      pull_request:
        types:
          - closed
        branches: [main]

    jobs:
      dev-push:
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/dev'
        env:
          ## Sets DEV Deployment API token credential as an environment variable
          ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEV_ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy <your-dev-deployment-id>
      prod-push:
        if: github.event.action == 'closed' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true
        env:
          ## Sets PROD Deployment API token credential as an environment variable
          ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PROD_ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy <your-prod-deployment-id>
    ```

<TabItem value="custom">

If your Astro project requires additional build-time arguments to build an image, you need to define these build arguments using Docker's [`build-push-action`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action). This template always pushes your entire project [as an image](deploy-project-image.md) to Astro.

#### Prerequisites

- An Astro project that requires additional build-time arguments to build the Runtime image.

#### Setup

1. Set the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

  - `ASTRO_API_TOKEN`: The value for your Workspace or Organization API token.

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Additional build-time args

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}
        steps:
        - name: Check out the repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Create image tag
          id: image_tag
          run: echo ::set-output name=image_tag::astro-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
        - name: Build image
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
          with:
            tags: ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
            load: true
            # Define your custom image's build arguments, contexts, and connections here using
            # the available GitHub Action settings:
            # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action#customizing .
            # This example uses `build-args` , but your use case might require configuring
            # different values.
            build-args: |
              <your-build-arguments>
        - name: Deploy to Astro
          run: |
            curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
            astro deploy <your-deployment-id> --image-name ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
    ```

For example, to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a project which [installs Python packages from a private GitHub repository](cli/private-python-packages.md), you would use the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  name: Astronomer CI - Custom base image

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      env:
        ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}
      steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Create image tag
        id: image_tag
        run: echo ::set-output name=image_tag::astro-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
      - name: Create SSH Socket
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4
        with:
          # GITHUB_SSH_KEY must be defined as a GitHub secret.
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_SSH_KEY }}
      - name: (Optional) Test SSH Connection - Should print hello message.
        run: (ssh git@github.com) || true
      - name: Build image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          tags: ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
          load: true
          ssh: |
            github=${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }
      - name: Deploy to Astro
        run: |
          curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
          astro deploy <your-deployment-id> --image-name ${{ steps.image_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
  ```
