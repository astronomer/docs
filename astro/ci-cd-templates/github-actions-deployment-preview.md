:::tip

The Astro GitHub integration can automatically deploy code from a GitHub repository to Astro without you needing to configure a GitHub action. In addition, the Astro UI shows Git metadata for each deploy on your Deployment information screen. See [Deploy code with the Astro GitHub integration](deploy-github-integration.md) for setup steps.

:::

The Astronomer [deploy action](https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action/tree/deployment-preview#deployment-preview-templates) includes several sub-actions that can be used together to create a complete [Deployment preview](ci-cd-templates/template-overview.md#preview-deployment-templates) pipeline, a configuration that allows you to test your code changes in an ephemeral development Deployment before promoting your changes to a production Astro Deployment.

The Deployment preview templates use GitHub secrets to manage the credentials needed for GitHub to authenticate to Astro. You can specify the credentials for your [secrets backend](secrets-backend.md) so that preview Deployments have access to secret [Apache AirflowÂ®](https://airflow.apache.org/) variables or connections during tests. See [Deployment preview template with secrets backend implementation](#deployment-preview-template-with-secrets-backend-implementation).

Deployment preview templates use Astronomer's [`deploy-action`](github-actions-deploy-action.md) to automates the deploy process, meaning it can selectively deploy parts of your project based on which files you changed. See [Standard deploy templates](ci-cd-templates/github-actions-deploy-action.md) for more information about the `deploy-action`.

## Prerequisites

- An [Astro project](cli/develop-project.md#create-an-astro-project) hosted in a GitHub repository.
- An [Astro Deployment](create-deployment.md).
- A [Deployment API token](deployment-api-tokens.md), [Workspace API token](workspace-api-tokens.md), or [Organization API token](organization-api-tokens.md).
- Access to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Specific templates might have additional requirements.

:::warning

Creating preview Deployments for Deployments that use a [private image registry](kubernetespodoperator.md#run-images-from-a-private-registry) is currently unsupported.

:::

:::warning

If you use a [self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) to execute jobs from GitHub Actions, the Astro CLI's `config.yaml` file, which stores default deploy details, might be shared across your organization and hence multiple CI/CD pipelines. To reduce the risk of accidentally deploying to the wrong Deployment, ensure the following:

- Add `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` to your repository and include a check in your GitHub workflow to verify that it exists.
- Use Deployment API tokens, which are scoped only to one Deployment, instead of Workspace or Organization API tokens.
- Specify `deployment-id` or `deployment-name` in your action. For example, `astro deploy <deployment-id>` or `astro deploy -n <deployment-name>`.
- Add the command `astro logout` at the end of your workflow to ensure that your authentication token is cleared from the `config.yaml` file.

## Standard Deployment preview template

The standard Deployment preview template uses GitHub secrets and an Astro Deployment API token to create a preview Deployment whenever you create a new feature branch off of your main branch.

### Setup

1. Copy and save the Deployment ID for your Astro deployment.
2. Set the following [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in the repository hosting your Astro project:

  - Key: `ASTRO_API_TOKEN`
  - Secret: `<your-token>`

3. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` named `create-deployment-preview.yml` that includes the following configuration.

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Create preview Deployment

    on:
      create:
        branches:
          - "**"

    env:
      ## Sets Deployment API Token credentials as environment variables or GitHub Secret depending on your configuration
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Create preview Deployment
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            action: create-deployment-preview
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

4. In the same folder, create a new YAML file named `deploy-to-preview.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code to preview

    on:
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Set your API token as a GitHub secret
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Deploy code to preview
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            action: deploy-deployment-preview
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

5. In the same folder, create a new YAML file named `delete-preview-deployment.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Delete Preview Deployment

    on:
      delete:
        branches:
          - "**"
    env:
      ## Set your API token as a GitHub secret
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Delete preview Deployment
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            action: delete-deployment-preview
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

6. In the same folder, create a new YAML file named `deploy-to-main-deployment.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code to main Deployment

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Set your API token as a GitHub secret
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Deploy code to main Deployment
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

    All four workflow files must have the same Deployment ID specified. The actions use this Deployment ID to create and delete preview Deployments based on your main Deployment.

## Deployment preview template with secrets backend implementation

If you use a [secrets backend](secrets-backend.md) to manage Airflow objects such as variables and connections, you can configure your action to grant preview Deployments access to your secrets backend. This means that DAGs in the preview Deployment can access your secret Airflow objects for testing purposes.

This template makes use of the `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS` environment variable to store information and credentials for your secrets backend.

### Prerequisites

- A [secrets backend](secrets-backend.md), such as Hashicorp Vault.

### Setup

1. Copy and save the Deployment ID for your Astro deployment.
2. Set the following [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in the repository hosting your Astro project. This includes your Astro API Token, so that GitHub has permissions to deploy code to your Deployments or Workspaces, and your secrets backend information stored in `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS`. See [Configure a secrets backend](secrets-backend.md) for more information about configuring your secrets backend as an environment variable.

    - **Key 1**: `ASTRO_API_TOKEN`
    - **Secret 1**: `<your-token>`
    - **Key 2**: `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS`
    - **Secret 2**: `<your-kwargs>`

3. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows` named `create-deployment-preview.yml` that includes the following configuration.

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Create preview Deployment with Secrets Backend

    on:
      create:
        branches:
          - "**"

    env:
      ## Sets Deployment API token credentials as environment variables
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - steps:
          - name: Create Deployment Preview
            uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.3
            with:
              action: create-deployment-preview
              deployment-name: "test"
              id: create-dep-prev
          - name: Create Secret Variables
            run: |
              astro deployment variable update --deployment-id ${{steps.create-dep-prev.outputs.preview-id}} AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS=${{ secrets.AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS }} --secret
    ```

4. In the same folder, create a new YAML file named `deploy-to-preview.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code to preview

    on:
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Set your API token as a GitHub secret
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Deploy code to preview
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            action: deploy-deployment-preview
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

5. In the same folder, create a new YAML file named `delete-preview-deployment.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Delete Preview Deployment

    on:
      delete:
        branches:
          - "**"
    env:
      ## Set your API token as a GitHub secret
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Delete preview Deployment
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            action: delete-deployment-preview
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

6. In the same folder, create a new YAML file named `deploy-to-main-deployment.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Astronomer CI - Deploy code to main Deployment

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    env:
      ## Set your API token as a GitHub secret
      ASTRO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASTRO_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Deploy code to main Deployment
          uses: astronomer/deploy-action@v0.4
          with:
            deployment-id: <main-deployment-id>
    ```

    All four workflow files must have the same Deployment ID specified. The actions use this Deployment ID to create and delete preview Deployments based on your main Deployment.
