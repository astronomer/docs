Use Markdown cells to document your pipeline and make it easier for team members to collaborate on the same code. Your Markdown cell appears as a top-level comment in the generated DAG for your data pipeline. It does not appear in the Airflow UI and is not related to the the documentation features described in [Create DAG documentation in Apache Airflow](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/custom-airflow-ui-docs-tutorial).

## Create pipeline documentation

1. In the pipeline editor, click **Add Cell**, then select **Markdown**.
2. In the body of the cell, write your documentation in Markdown format. 

To view your documentation in the Cloud IDE, click **Code**.
