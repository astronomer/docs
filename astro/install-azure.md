To complete the installation process, you'll:

- Add the Astronomer Service Principal to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) instance.
- Assign the Astronomer Service Principal an Owner role to your subscription.
- Register Microsoft Azure features.

When you've completed the installation process, Astronomer support creates a cluster within your Azure subscription to host the resources and Apache Airflow components necessary to deploy DAGs and execute tasks.

For more information about managing Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI, see [How to manage Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli).

## Set up

    values={[
        {label: 'Self-hosted', value: 'byoc'},
        {label: 'Astronomer-hosted', value: 'astronomer hosted data plane'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="byoc">

### Prerequisites

- A clean Azure subscription. For security reasons, Azure subscriptions with existing tooling running aren't supported. Also, the subscription must be included in an Azure management group that doesn't apply Azure policies. See [What are Azure management groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview).
- An Azure AD user with the following role assignments:
    - `Application Administrator`. See [Understand roles in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/concept-understand-roles).
    - `Owner` with permission to create and manage subscription resources of all types. See [Azure built-in roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

    These role assignments are required for cluster creation, and can be removed after the cluster is created.
- Microsoft Azure CLI or Azure Az PowerShell module.  See [How to install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
- A minimum quota of 48 Standard Ddv5-series vCPUs in the deployment region. You can use Dv5-series vCPUs, but you'll need 96 total vCPUs composed of 48 Ddv5-series vCPUs and 48 Dv5-series vCPUs. To adjust your quota limits up or down, see [Increase VM-family vCPU quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests).
- A subscription to the [Astro Status Page](https://status.astronomer.io). This ensures that you're alerted when an incident occurs or when scheduled maintenance is planned.
- The following domains added to your organization's allowlist for any user and CI/CD environments:
    - `https://cloud.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://astro-<your-org>.datakin.com/`
    - `https://<your-org>.astronomer.run/`
    - `https://api.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://images.astronomer.cloud/`
    - `https://auth.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://updates.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://install.astronomer.io/`

For more information about the resources required to run Astro on Azure, see [Azure Resource Reference](resource-reference-azure.md).

#### VNet peering prerequisites (Optional)

To give Astro access to any Azure resources on a private network, you must create a VNet peering connection between Astronomer's VNet and the VNets for your broader network. 

To create a VNet peering connection, contact [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io/) and provide the following details:

- Azure TenantID of the target VNet
- Subscription ID of the target VNet
- Region of the target VNet
- VNet ID of the target VNet
- ResourceGroup of the target VNet
- A CIDR block (RFC 1918 IP Space) no smaller than a `/19` range. This CIDR block can't overlap with any Azure VNet(s) that you will peer with later. The default CIDR range is `172.20.0.0/19`.
- ResourceID, for example: `/subscriptions/<Subscription Id>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupA/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetA`. You can find the resource ID in the Azure portal by following step 7 in [Create peering - Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-peering-different-subscriptions#portal).

Additionally, ensure that your Azure AD user has at least one of the following role assignments: 

-  Network Contributor: This permission is required for any VNet deployed through Resource Manager.
-  Classic Network Contributor: This permission is required for any VNet deployed through the classic deployment model.
  
From here, Astronomer support will set up the VNet connection to Astro.

### Access Astro

1. Go to https://cloud.astronomer.io/ and create an account, or enter your email address, and then click **Continue**.
