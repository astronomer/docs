**We are excited to announce that you can now subscribe to Astronomer Release Notes!**
Astronomer has created RSS feeds for Astro Release Notes, Astro CLI Release Notes, and Astro Runtime Release Notes. You can subscribe to the RSS feeds directly, or configure updates to be sent directly to your email or Slack.
