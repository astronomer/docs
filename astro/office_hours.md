Office hours are a new way for Astro customers to meet with the talented Data Engineers.
These sessions are typically 30 minutes long and are available weekly on a first-come-first-serve basis.

:::alert

Office hours are _not_ a replacement for support - please [submit a support request](astro-support.md) if you have any urgent issue, bug, or something that needs fixing. We will not be able to assist you with these topics during office hours sessions.

:::

Additionally, please browse the content of our documentation, the [Astronomer Academy](https://academy.astronomer.io/), our [Airflow Guides](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/), or discussion on the [Astronomer Forum](https://forum.astronomer.io) to see if there is already available guides or resources for what you would like to discuss.

You can also email [mailto:success@astronomer.io] for general account related questions.

Examples of possible Office Hour topics:
- Ask questions about Airflow features
- Discuss new Astro features or provide feedback
- Get insight on integrating Airflow with a new system 
- Do an Architecture Review or discuss scaling Airflow and Astro Deployments 
- Conduct a code-review for a DAG

If you need more extensive assistance or guidance, please talk to our [Professional Services](https://www.astronomer.io/professional-services/) team.
