Astro is the industry's leading managed service for Apache Airflow.

You can quickly learn how Astro works by running an Apache Airflow DAG with either [the Astro CLI](first-DAG-cli.md) or by using [GitHub Actions](first-DAG-github-actions.md).

Either tutorial takes about 15 minutes. They each showcase different paths available for DAG development, CI/CD workflows, and code deployment options. You'll learn how to:

- Authenticate and log in to Astro.
- Create a Deployment.
- Deploy DAGs to Astro with the Astro CLI.
- Trigger a run of an example DAG in the Airflow UI.

If you're new to Airflow and want a more in-depth tutorial, see [Write your First DAG](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/get-started-with-airflow).

## Compare your options

If you prefer to develop on your local machine and use command line tools, follow the steps in [Run your first DAG with the Astro CLI](first-DAG-cli.md).

If you can't install additional tools on your current machine or you prefer a no-code workflow, follow the steps in [Run your first DAG with GitHub Actions](first-DAG-github-actions.md).

| Scenario                               | Recommendation |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Explore local development              | Astro CLI      |
| Don't want to install software locally | GitHub Actions |
| Try a CI/CD workflow                   | GitHub Actions |
