[Data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage) is the concept of tracking data from its origin to wherever it is consumed downstream as it flows through a data pipeline. This includes connections between datasets and tables in a database as well as rich metadata about the tasks that create and transform data. You can observe data lineage to trace the history of a dataset, troubleshoot run failures, manage personally identifiable information (PII), and ensure compliance with data regulations.

All Astro Deployments use the [OpenLineage Airflow library](https://openlineage.io/integration/apache-airflow/) (`openlineage-airflow`) to gather lineage data. The OpenLineage Airflow library is installed on [Astro Runtime](runtime-image-architecture.md) by default.

There are two ways to emit lineage data:

- Run a task on Astro with a supported Airflow operator. These operators use extractors to automatically emit lineage data and don’t require additional configuration. See [Supported Airflow operators](data-lineage-support-and-compatibility.md#supported-airflow-operators).
- Integrate OpenLineage with an external service, such as dbt or Apache Spark, to emit data lineage outside of an Airflow DAG or task. This might require additional configuration.

The data lineage graph in the Cloud UI shows lineage data that is emitted with both methods, including tasks or jobs that are not run on Astro. This graph can provide context to your data before, during, and after it reaches your Deployment. See [View data lineage](data-lineage.md).

## Integrate Astro and OpenLineage with external systems

To store lineage data that is emitted from any system, a lineage backend is required. If you're an Astro customer, use Astro as a lineage backend instead of configuring a custom solution with a tool such as [Marquez](https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/). To emit lineage data from Airflow tasks that run on Astro, Astro is automatically set as the lineage backend and no additional configuration is required.

To emit lineage data from an Airflow task that runs outside of Astro or from an external system that does not interact with Airflow:

- Retrieve an OpenLineage API key from Astro. There is only one API key for each Organization.
- Specify your OpenLineage API key in the external system.
- Set Astro as your OpenLineage backend.

### Retrieve an OpenLineage API key

1. In the Cloud UI, click **Settings**.
2. Copy the value in the **Lineage API Key** field.
3. Specify your Organization's OpenLineage API key in the external system's configuration.

## OpenLineage and Snowflake

Lineage data emitted from [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is similar to what is collected from other SQL databases, including Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery. However, Snowflake is unique in that it emits [query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging.html#what-is-a-tag) that provides additional task execution detail that other databases don't provide.

When you run a task in Airflow that interacts with Snowflake, the query tag allows each task to be directly matched with the Snowflake query or queries that are run by that task. If the task fails, for example, you can look up the Snowflake query that was executed by that task and reduce the time required to troubleshoot the task failure.

To emit lineage data from Snowflake:

1. Add a Snowflake connection to Airflow. See [Snowflake connection](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-snowflake/stable/connections/snowflake.html).
2. Run an Airflow DAG or task with the [`SnowflakeOperator`](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/snowflake/modules/snowflakeoperator) or `SnowflakeOperatorAsync`. This operator is officially supported by OpenLineage and does not require additional configuration.

### Lineage data collected for Snowflake

When you run an Airflow task with the `SnowflakeOperator`, you can view the following information in the Cloud UI **Lineage** page:

- Task duration
- Queries
- Query duration
- Upstream datasets
- Downstream datasets
- Quality metrics based on dataset and column-level checks, including successes and failures per run.

When you access this data on Astro, you can:

- See average task execution times, compare duration across tasks, and identify outliers.
- See the query that each task runs. This is available in the Cloud UI **Info** page.
- Form a local data dictionary based on the type information and description that is emitted with dataset lineage.

The dataset lineage includes the table schema, with type information and descriptions when available, that forms a local data dictionary. Quality metrics are also aggregated on data, based on dataset- and column-level checks. These checks show success and failures over the course of runs. Metadata metrics for row count and bytes received are also displayed. These check facets can be populated with the `SQLColumnCheckOperator`, `SQLTableCheckOperator`, Great Expectations, or dbt test.

Together, this information provides a robust amount of data to help data stakeholders analyze their pipelines and trace data.

When collecting lineage data for Snowflake with Airflow emitting OpenLineage, you should expect to collect information about the input and output datasets of jobs for certain queries. This appears in the Lineage page in Astro as a link between the relevant Airflow task and the datasets it operates on. Data is also enriched by Snowflake’s query tags when running tasks on Airflow using the `SnowflakeOperator` and `SnowflakeAsyncOperator` by adding that tag to the job’s run facet.

#### Setup

Like other [supported Airflow operators](data-lineage-support-and-compatibility.md#supported-airflow-operators), the [SnowflakeOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/snowflake/modules/snowflakeoperator) has full data lineage support and capabilities by default. As long as you connect to Snowflake through an Airflow connection, any task using the SnowflakeOperator emits lineage data about the Snowflake tables it queries.

#### Verify 

After you run a DAG with the SnowflakeOperator, open the **Lineage** page in the Cloud UI and then click **Lineage** in the left menu. The task using the SnowflakeOperator appears as a run connected to a dataset. Click the dataset to view:

- The time that Snowflake was accessed.
- Tables that were accessed by upstream or downstream tasks.
- The name and description for each column in the dataset.
- Data quality checks for the accessed tables. Data quality checks require integrating Great Expectations with OpenLineage and Airflow. See [Integrate with Great Expectations](#integrate-with-great-expectations) and [Orchestrate Great Expectations with Airflow](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-great-expectations#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback).

### Make source code visible for Airflow operators

Because Workspace permissions are not yet applied to the **Lineage** page, viewing source code for [supported Airflow operators](data-lineage-support-and-compatibility.md#supported-airflow-operators) is off by default. If you want users across Workspaces to be able to view source code for Airflow tasks in a given Deployment, create an [environment variable](environment-variables.md) in the Deployment with a key of `OPENLINEAGE_AIRFLOW_DISABLE_SOURCE_CODE` and a value of `False`. Astronomer recommends enabling this feature only for Deployments with non-sensitive code and workflows.

### OpenLineage and Databricks

Use the information provided here to set up lineage collection for Spark running on a Databricks cluster.

#### Prerequisites

- A [Databricks cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create-cluster.html).

### Setup

1. In your Databricks File System [(DBFS)](https://docs.databricks.com/data/databricks-file-system.html), create a new directory at `dbfs:/databricks/openlineage/`.
2. Download the latest OpenLineage `jar` file to the new directory. See [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openlineage/openlineage-spark).
3. Download the `open-lineage-init-script.sh` file to the new directory. See [OpenLineage GitHub](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/main/integration/spark/databricks/open-lineage-init-script.sh).
4. In Databricks, run this command to create a [cluster-scoped init script](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/init-scripts.html#example-cluster-scoped-init-script) and install the `openlineage-spark` library at cluster initialization:

    ```sh
        dbfs:/databricks/openlineage/open-lineage-init-script.sh
    ```

5. In the cluster configuration page for your Databricks cluster, specify the following [Spark configuration](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/configure.html#spark-configuration):

   ```sh
      bash
   spark.driver.extraJavaOptions -Djava.security.properties=
   spark.executor.extraJavaOptions -Djava.security.properties=
   spark.openlineage.url https://<your-astro-base-domain>
   spark.openlineage.apiKey <your-lineage-api-key>
   spark.openlineage.namespace <NAMESPACE_NAME> // Astronomer recommends using a meaningful namespace like `spark-dev`or `spark-prod`.
   ```

> **Note:** You override the JVM security properties for the spark _driver_ and _executor_ with an _empty_ string as some TLS algorithms are disabled by default. For a more information, see [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/170730/handshake-fails-trying-to-connect-from-azure-datab.html) discussion.

After you save this configuration, lineage is enabled for all Spark jobs running on your cluster.

### Verify Setup

To test that lineage was configured correctly on your Databricks cluster, run a test Spark job on Databricks. After your job runs, click **Lineage** in the Cloud UI and then click **Runs** in the left menu. If your configuration is successful, your Spark job appears in the table of most recent runs. Click a job run to see it within a lineage graph.

## OpenLineage and dbt

Use the information provided here to set up lineage collection for a dbt project.

### Prerequisites

- A [dbt project](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/projects).
- The [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/cli-overview) v0.20+.
- Your Astro base domain.
- Your Organization's OpenLineage API key.

### Setup

1. On your local machine, run the following command to install the [`openlineage-dbt`](https://pypi.org/project/openlineage-dbt) library:

   ```sh
   $ pip install openlineage-dbt
   ```

2. Configure the following environment variables in your shell:

   ```bash
   OPENLINEAGE_URL=https://<your-astro-base-domain>
   OPENLINEAGE_API_KEY=<your-lineage-api-key>
   OPENLINEAGE_NAMESPACE=<NAMESPACE_NAME> # Replace with the name of your dbt project.
                                          # Astronomer recommends using a meaningful namespace such as `dbt-dev` or `dbt-prod`.
   ```

3. Run the following command to generate the [`catalog.json`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/catalog-json) file for your dbt project:

   ```bash
   $ dbt docs generate
   ```

4. In your dbt project, run the [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io/integration/dbt/) wrapper script using the `dbt run` [command](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run):

   ```bash
   $ dbt-ol run
   ```

### Verify Setup

To confirm that your setup is successful, run a dbt model in your project. After you run this model, click **Lineage** in the Cloud UI and and then click **Runs** in the left menu. If the setup is successful, the run that you triggered appears in the table of most recent runs.

## OpenLineage and Great Expectations

Use the information provided here to set up lineage collection for a running Great Expectations suite.

This guide outlines how to set up lineage collection for a Great Expectations project.

#### Prerequisites

- A [Great Expectations project](https://legacy.docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/guides/tutorials/getting_started.html#tutorials-getting-started).
- Your Astro base domain.
- Your Organization's OpenLineage API key.

#### Setup

If you use the `GreatExpectationsOperator` version 0.2.0 or later and don't use a custom Checkpoint or Checkpoint Config, the operator detects your Astro OpenLineage configuration and sends lineage information automatically. If you use custom Checkpoints, complete the following steps:

1. Update your `great_expectations.yml` file to add `OpenLineageValidationAction` to your `action_list_operator` configuration:

    ```yml
    validation_operators:
      action_list_operator:
        class_name: ActionListValidationOperator
        action_list:
          - name: openlineage
            action:
              class_name: OpenLineageValidationAction
              module_name: openlineage.common.provider.great_expectations
              openlineage_host: https://<your-astro-base-domain>
              openlineage_apiKey: <your-lineage-api-key>
              openlineage_namespace: <NAMESPACE_NAME> # Replace with your job namespace; Astronomer recommends using a meaningful namespace such as `dev` or `prod`.
              job_name: validate_my_dataset
    ```

2. Lineage support for GreatExpectations requires the use of the `ActionListValidationOperator`. In each of your checkpoint's xml files in `checkpoints/`, set the `validation_operator_name` configuration to `action_list_operator`:

    ```xml
    name: check_users
    config_version:
    module_name: great_expectations.checkpoint
    class_name: LegacyCheckpoint
    validation_operator_name: action_list_operator
    batches:
      - batch_kwargs:
    ```

### Verify

To confirm that your setup is successful, click **Lineage** in the Cloud UI and then click **Issues** in the left menu. Recent data quality assertion issues appear in the **All Issues** table.

If your code hasn't produced any data quality assertion issues, use the search bar to search for a dataset and view its node on the lineage graph for a recent job run. Click **Quality** to view metrics and assertion pass or fail counts.

## OpenLineage and Spark

Use the information provided here to set up lineage collection for Spark.

### Prerequisites

- A Spark application.
- A Spark job.
- Your Astro base domain.
- Your Organization's OpenLineage API key.

### Setup

In your Spark application, set the following properties to configure your lineage endpoint, install the [`openlineage-spark`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openlineage/openlineage-spark) library, and configure an _OpenLineageSparkListener_:

   ```python
   SparkSession.builder \
     .config('spark.jars.packages', 'io.openlineage:openlineage-spark:0.2.+')
     .config('spark.extraListeners', 'io.openlineage.spark.agent.OpenLineageSparkListener')
     .config('spark.openlineage.host', 'https://<your-astro-base-domain>')
     .config('spark.openlineage.apiKey', '<your-lineage-api-key>')
     .config('spark.openlineage.namespace', '<NAMESPACE_NAME>') # Replace with the name of your Spark cluster.
     .getOrCreate()                                             # Astronomer recommends using a meaningful namespace such as `spark-dev` or `spark-prod`.
   ```

### Verify

To confirm that your setup is successful, run a Spark job after you save your configuration. After you run this model, click **Lineage** in the Cloud UI and then click **Runs** in the left menu. Your recent Spark job run appears in the table of most recent runs.
