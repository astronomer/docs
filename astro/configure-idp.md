There are 4 ways users can to authenticate to Astro:

- Basic authentication
- Google social login
- GitHub social login
- 3rd-party identity provider (IdP) login

Identity Providers (IdPs) are services that manage user accounts. As organizations grow, it's common for teams to integrate internal tooling with a third-party IdP. This allows administrators to monitor application access, user permissions, and security policies from a single place. It also makes it easy for individual users to access the tools they need.

Astro supports integrations with the following IdPs:

- [Azure Active Directory (AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)
- [Okta](https://www.okta.com/)
- [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/)
- [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html)

This guide provides setup steps for integrating both of these identity providers on Astro. Once you complete the integration for your organization:

- Users will automatically be authenticated to Astro if they're already logged in to your IdP.
- Users will no longer have to repeatedly login and remember credentials for their account.
- You will have complete ownership over credential configuration and management on Astro.
- You can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users.
- You can use services such as [Adaptive Authentication](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/adaptive-authentication/) and [Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) to create advanced access policies that enforce trusted IP ranges or limit access to authorized devices.

Astro only supports Service Provider (SP)-initiated SSO. Users are required to log in to the [Cloud UI](https://cloud.astronomer.io/).

        {label: 'Ping Identity', value: 'Ping Identity'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="Okta">

This section provides setup steps for setting up Okta as your IdP on Astro. After completing this setup, all users in your organization can use Okta to log in to Astro.

#### Prerequisites

To integrate Okta as your IdP for Astro, you must have an [Okta account](https://www.okta.com/) with administrative access.

#### Step 1: Contact Astronomer support

To set up Okta as your IdP, submit a request to [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). After receiving your request, Astronomer support will provide you with the following:

- A Single Sign-On (SSO) URL
- An Audience URI

These values are required for Step 2.

#### Step 2: Configure Okta

1. Create a SAML app integration in the Okta Admin Console. See [Create SAML app integrations using AIW](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_SAML.htm). Complete the following fields:

    - **Single sign on URL**: `<your-sso-url>`
    - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: `<your-audience-uri>`
    - **Name ID format**: `Unspecified`
    - **Application username**: `Email`
    - **Update application username on**: `Create and update`

2. In the **Advanced Settings** section of your configuration, set the following values:

    - **Response**: `Signed`
    - **Assertion Signature**: `Signed`
    - **Signature Algorithm**: `RSA-SHA256`
    - **Digest Algorithm**: `SHA256`
    - **Assertion Encryption**: `Unencrypted`

3. In the **Attribute Statements** section of your configuration, create the following four attribute statements, making sure to use the exact capitalization as shown:

    | Name      | Name Format | Value            |
    | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
    | email     | Unspecified | user.email       |
    | firstName | Unspecified | user.firstName   |
    | lastName  | Unspecified | user.lastName    |
    | name      | Unspecified | user.displayName |

  :::info

  These values might be different if Okta is connected to an Active Directory. In this case, replace each `Value` with the equivalent Active Directory values for a user's first name, last name, and full email address.

  :::

4. Complete the remainder of the setup as documented in Okta until you finish creating your integration.

#### Step 3: Provide Astronomer support with your integration information

On the page for your Okta app integration, click **View Setup Instructions**. Copy the values for **Single Sign-on URL** and **X.509 Certificate** that appear. Then, send the following information to Astronomer support:

- Your **Single Sign-on URL**.
- Your **X.509 Certificate**.
- A list of domains that you own and should be authorized to access your Astro Organization. After the integration is complete, any new user that logs in to Astro with an email address from one of these domains is automatically granted a new Astro account and access to your Organization through just-in-time provisioning. To disable just-in-time provisioning, make a request through Astronomer support.

Astronomer support configures your Organization's integration with Okta and sends you a validation link that you'll use in step 4.

#### Step 4: Confirm the integration 

Open the validation link provided by Astronomer support and then log in to Astro with your credentials. After you validate that authentication works, Astro finalizes the integration. 

#### Step 5: Assign users to your Okta application

On the page for your Okta app integration, open the **Assignments** tab. Ensure that all users who will use Astro are assigned to the integration. For more information, see [Assign applications to users](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-assign-apps.htm).
