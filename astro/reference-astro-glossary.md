| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| API Key | An API key is a unique key ID and secret pair that identifies a Deployment to automate deploys, manage Deployments as code, or use the Airflow REST API. API keys will be deprecatd soon in favor of API tokens. |
| API Token | An API token is an alphanumeric token used to automate operations for a Workspace or Organization. See [Organization API token](organization-api-tokens.md) or [Workspace API token](workspace-api-tokens.md). |
| Astro | SaaS application that provides fully-managed Apache Airflow service in cloud allowing customers to run multiple Airflow environments in one or more Kuberentes clusters. Each Airflow environment runs in its own isolated namespace with the ability to scale up or down based on the number of tasks queued or running. See [Astro Architecture](astro-architecture.md) |
| Astro Alerts | Astro Alerts is a feature for creating Slack and Pagerduty alerts for Deployments running on Astro. Unlike Airflow alerts, Astro alerts are configured directly from the Cloud UI and require no changes to the DAG code. See [Alerts](alerts.md) |
| Astro CLI | The Astro CLI is a command line interface used to run Airflow locally enabling users to develop and test DAGs. It also enables users to interact with Deployments on Astro to automate management processes and manage CI/CD. See [Astro CLI](cli/overview.md). |
| Astro Hosted | Astro Hosted is a version of Astro that's hosted and managed in Astronomer's cloud. It provides access to Cloud UI to manage all the Airflow Deployments running on a Kubernetes cluster in Astronomer's cloud. [Try Astro](https://www.astronomer.io/try-astro/) |
| Astro Hybrid | Astro Hybrid is a version of Astro that's managed by Astronomer but is hosted in customer's cloud. It provides customers access to Cloud UI to manage all the Airflow Deployments running in their cloud. The cloud environment that runs the cluster is referred to as the Data Plane. See [Astro Hybrid](hybrid-overview.md). |
| Astro project | An Astro project that contains the set of files necessary to run Airflow, including dedicated folders for the DAG files, plugins, and dependencies. A new Astro project can be created by running `astro dev init` with the Astro CLI. Each Deployment hosts exactly one Astro project. See [Develop your Astro project](develop-project.md). |
| Astro Runtime | Astro Runtime is an Astronomer-distributed Docker image for running Airflow. Compared to the Apache Airflow Docker image, Astro Runtime additionally includes smart default environment variables and packages, a security manager for RBAC, and expedited vulnerability fixes. See [Astro Runtime architecture](runtime-image-architecture.md) |
| Astronomer Software | Astronomer Software is a product for running Apache Airflow in a private cloud or airgapped environment using Kubernetes. See [Astronomer Software](https://docs.astronomer.io/software) |
| Cell | A cell is a UI-based abstraction of an Airflow task, and is the core building block for Astro Cloud IDE pipelines. It can either complete a unit of work or host an asset to be used by other cells. See [Cloud IDE Quickstart](cloud-ide/quickstart.md) |
| Cloud UI | The Cloud UI is the user interface for accessing Astro. From the Cloud UI, users can manage Organizations, Workspaces, and Deployments, as well as develop pipelines in the Astro Cloud IDE. The Cloud UI is available at https://cloud.astronomer.io. See [Login to the Cloud UI](log-in-to-astro#log-in-to-the-cloud-ui) |
| Cluster | An Astro cluster is a fully managed Kubernetes cluster that runs Deployments either in customer's cloud or Astronomer's cloud. |
| Standard cluster | A standard cluster is mult-tenant, running Deployments from multiple Organizations and is available of Astro Hosted. See [Standard cluster configurations](resource-reference-hosted#standard-cluster-configurations). |
| Dedicated Cluster | A dedicated cluster runs Deployments only from a single Organization. Dedicated cluster is available on Astro Hosted running on Astronomer's cloud or in customer's cloud. See [Astro Hosted dedicated cluster](create-dedicated-cluster.md) and [Astro Hybrid cluster](manage-hybrid-clusters#create-a-cluster) |
| Control Plane | The Astro control plane is Astronomer's interface for managing all Airflow environments of an Organization in the cloud. The Cloud UI or the Astro CLI is used to interact with the control plane. It provides end-to-end visibility, control, and management of users, teams, Workspaces, Deployments, metrics, and logs. See [Astro architecture](astro-architecture.md).|
| DAG Bundle Version | A DAG Bundle Version unique timestamp generated by the Astro CLI after a user completes a DAG-only deploy. This value exists only when DAG-only deploys are enabled for a Deployment. See [Deploy DAGs only](deploy-code#deploy-dags-only). |
| Data Lineage | Data lineage is the concept of tracking and observing data flowing through a data pipeline. Data lineage can be used to understand data sources, troubleshoot run failures, manage personally identifiable information (PII), and ensure compliance with data regulations. Astro includes data lineage features in the Cloud UI. See [Data Lineage](data-lineage-concepts.md) |
| Data Plane | The Data Plane is a component of Astro Hybrid, that provides a single tenant foundation in customer's cloud which runs the infrastructure required to run multiple Airflow environments. A Data plane can be multi-cloud and multi-region. It can have more than one cluster and each cluster can have more than one Deployment. See [Astro Hybrid](hybrid-overview.md). |
| Deploy | Deploy is the process of pushing an Astro project either as an entire Astro Runtime image or just DAG code to an Astro Deployment. See [Deploy Code](deploy-code.md). |
| Deployment | An Astro Deployment is an Airlfow environment that is powered by all core Airflow components, including a webserver, scheduler, triggerer, and one or more workers running in its own isolated namespace in the cluster. Customers can deploy DAGs to a Deployment, and can have one or more Deployments within a Workspace. See [Create a Deployment](create-deployment.md). |
| Environment Variable| Environment Variable in Astro includes all the default configurations that are applicable to an Airflow environment. Users can override many of the environment variables with some execeptions using the Deployment page in the Cloud UI or using the Dockerfile. |
| High availability (HA) | High availability (HA) is a feature on Astro for ensuring the Deployments can run even in the event of an outage. On Astro Hosted, HA feature can be enabled or disabled per Deployment. See [Enable high availability](configure-deployment-resources#enable-high-availability). |
| Namespace | A namespace is a way to isolate Airflow environments within a kubernetes cluster. Each Aiflow environment running in a Deployment uses a separate namespace to isolate resources. See [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/). |
| Organization | An Organization is the highest management level on Astro. An Organization contains Workspaces, which are collections of Deployments, or Airflow environments, that are typically owned by a single team.  See [Create organization](trial#create-an-organization-and-workspace). |
| Pipeline | A pipeline is a notebook-style configuration for DAGs which is available in the Astro Cloud IDE. A pipeline can include traditional Airflow operators, as well as Python and SQL functions that are executed through the Astro Python SDK. See [Create a pipeline](cloud-ide/quickstart#step-2-create-a-pipeline). |
| Worker Node | A worker node is a node used to run Airflow worker Pods, which are responsible for executing Airflow tasks in the Deployments. A worker node can be of different types. See [Worker types](resource-reference-hosted#worker-type). |
| Worker Node Pool | A worker node pool is a Kubernetes node pool that's used to run worker nodes of a specific type. Each worker node pool has a worker type and a maximum node count. Worker node pool is a Astro Hybrid concept. See [About worker node pools](manage-hybrid-clusters#about-worker-node-pools). |
| Worker Queue | A worker queue is a set of configurations that apply to a group of workers in a Deployment running the Celery executor. Within a worker queue, users can configure worker type and size as well as autoscaling behavior. See [Configure worker queue](configure-worker-queues.md)|
| Worker Type | A worker type is the designated machine type for all worker nodes in a worker node pool. On Astro Hosted, worker types are defined in terms of Astronomer units (A5, A10, A20). On Astro Hybrid, worker types are defined by the cloud a customer uses for running Deployments(For example, m5.xlarge or e2-standard-4). |
| Workspace | Workspaces are collections of Deployments that can be accessed by a specific group of users. Workspaces can be used to group Deployments that share a business use case or environment trait. See [Manage Workspaces](manage-workspaces.md)|
