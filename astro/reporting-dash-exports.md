You can export data from your reporting dashboards, either as a file download, sent to an email address, or sent to an email address on a regular schedule. The reporting dashboard also offers you the ability to set up a *reporting dashboard alert*, or a scheduled data export that occurs when the data set meets certain conditional critera.

:::info

Only users with **Organization Billing Admin** [user permissions](user-permissions.md#organization-roles) can access reporting dashboards.

:::

Hover over the dashboard element whose data you want to export, and then expand the additional options menu to choose to either **Export** your data or **Alert when** to email your data to you when it meets your specified criteria.

When you receive a report via email, the sender appears as **Sigma Computing**. The subject line also includes the name of the dashboard element's data you exported.
