Astronomer shares release previews to give customers a chance to evaluate and provide feedback on features before they are generally available (GA). Release previews have a different degree of feature maturity. This document defines those release preview stages, and the levels of availability, support, and customer access granted at each stage.

To view the support commitment for GA releases of Astro Runtime, see [Astro Runtime maintenance and lifecycle policy](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.md). To submit feedback or a support request for a Public or Private Preview feature, see [Submit a support request](astro-support.md).

## Astro release previews

Astro features can be shared as Private Preview or Public Preview. The following table describes the differences between the different release preview types.

| Release preview type | Customer access | Availability                     | Support                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
