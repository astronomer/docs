Astronomer shares release previews to let customers provide feedback on features before they are generally available (GA). Release previews have a different degree of feature maturity compared to GA releases. Use this document to understand release preview stages, including their different levels of availability, support, and customer access. 

To view support promises for GA releases of Runtime, see [Astro Runtime maintenance and lifecycle policy](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.md). To submit feedback or a support request for a Public or Private Preview feature, see [Submit a support request](astro-support.md).

## Astro release previews

Astro features can be shared as Private Preview or Public Preview. The table below outlines how these release previews differ:

| Release Preview Type | Customer Access | Availability                  | Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private Preview      | Invite only.    | No SLA or SLO.                | Product and R&D will be in active communication with customers who are have a Private Preview of a feature to receive feedback, bug reports, questions, and more. Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) does not provide support for features in Private Preview.                                                                                             |
| Public Preview       | Everyone.       | No SLA. Internal SLOs supported by R&D and CRE. | CRE treats all issues within the feature as P3 or P4, depending on the nature of the issue. CRE continues to support remediation for all other issues at defined priority levels, including if a platform issue is caused by a feature in Public Preview. |
