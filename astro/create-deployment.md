An Astro Deployment is an Astro Runtime instance that is powered by the core components of Apache Airflow. This includes: the Airflow Webserver, the Triggerer, a Postgres metadata database, one or more Schedulers, and one or more workers. Every Deployment is hosted on a single Astro Cluster with its own dedicated resources and you can customize it to meet the unique requirements of your Organization. Every Astro Cluster operates with a primary database that hosts the individual databases for each Deployment.

Within a Workspace, you can create Deployments and push DAGs to any Deployment from the Astro CLI or from a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process. You can also invite other users to the Workspace and create Deployments.

If you prefer, you can run the `astrocloud deployment create` command in the Astro CLI to create a Deployment. See [CLI Command Reference](cli-reference/astrocloud-deployment-create.md).

1. Log in to the [Cloud UI](https://cloud.astronomer.io) and select a Workspace.
2. Click **Deployment**.
3. Complete the following fields:
    - **Name**: Enter a name for your Deployment.
    - **Astro Runtime**: By default, the latest version of Astro Runtime is selected. The Astro Runtime versions provided in the Cloud UI are limited to patches for the most recent major and minor releases. Deprecated versions of Astro Runtime aren't available.

        To upgrade the Astro Runtime version for your Deployment, youâ€™ll need to update your Docker image in your Astro project directory. For more information about upgrading Astro Runtime, see [Upgrade Astro Runtime](upgrade-runtime.md).

    - **Description**: Optional. Enter a description for your Deployment.
    - **Cluster**: Select the Astro Cluster in which you want to create this Deployment.
4. Optional. Edit the Deployment resource settings. See [Configure Deployment Resources](configure-deployment-resources.md). 
5. Click **Create Deployment**. 

    The initial status of all new Deployments is `UNHEALTHY`. This indicates that the Webserver and Scheduler for the DEployment are being created in your Astro Cluster. In a few minutes, the status changes to `HEALTHY`.

6. Optional. Click **Open Airflow** to access the Airflow UI.
