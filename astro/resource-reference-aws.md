## Overview

Unless otherwise specified, new Clusters on Astro are created with a set of default AWS resources that our team has deemed appropriate for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported Cluster configurations, including **AWS Region** and **Node Instance Type**.

## Default Cluster Values

| Resource                                  | Description                                                                                                                   | Quantity / Default Size |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [EKS Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) | An EKS cluster is required to run the Astro Data Plane, which hosts the resources and data required to execute Airflow tasks. | 1x                      |
| [EC2 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) | EC2 instances (nodes) power the system and Airflow components (Webserver, Scheduler, Workers). EC2 instances auto-scale for additional Airflow Deployments. | 2x m5.xlarge |

| [Elastic IPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) | Elastic IPs are required for connectivity with the Control Plane, and other public services. | 2x |
| [Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) | Subnets are provisioned in 2 different [Availability Zones (AZs)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) for redundancy, with 1 public and 1 private subnet per AZ. Public subnets are required for the NAT and Internet gateways, while private subnets are required for EC2 nodes. | 2x /26 (public) and 1x /20 + 1x /21 (private) |
| [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) | Required for connectivity with the Control Plane and other public services. | 1x |

## Supported Cluster Configurations

Depending on the needs of your team, you may be interested in modifying certain configurations of a new or existing Cluster on Astro. This section provides a reference for which configuration options are supported during the install process.

To create a new Cluster on Astro with a specified configuration, see [Install on AWS](install-aws.md) or [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.md). For instructions on how to make a change to an existing Cluster, see [Modify a Cluster](modify-cluster.md).

### AWS Region

Astro supports the following AWS regions:

- `af-south-1` - Africa (Cape Town)
- `ap-east-1` - Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
- `ap-northeast-1` - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
- `ap-northeast-2` - Asia Pacific (Seoul)
- `ap-northeast-3` - Asia Pacific (Osaka)
- `ap-southeast-1` - Asia Pacific (Singapore)
- `ap-southeast-2` - Asia Pacific (Sydney)
- `ap-south-1` - Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
- `ca-central-1` - Canada (Central)
- `me-south-1` - Middle East (Bahrain)
- `sa-east-1` - South America (SÃ£o Paulo)
- `us-east-1` - US East (N. Virginia)
- `us-east-2` - US East (Ohio)
- `us-west-1` - US West (N. California)
- `us-west-2` - US West (Oregon)

Modifying the region of an existing Cluster on Astro is not supported. If you're interested in an AWS region that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).

### RDS Instance Type

Every Astro Cluster on AWS is created with and requires an [RDS instance](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). RDS serves as a primary relational database for the Data Plane and powers the metadata database of each Astro Deployment within a single Cluster. During the Cluster creation process, you'll be asked to specify an RDS instance type according to your use case and expected workload, but it can be modified at any time.

Astro supports a variety of AWS RDS instance types. Instance types comprise of varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. For detailed information on each instance type, reference [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/). If you're interested in an RDS instance type that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).

### Node Instance Type

Astro supports a variety of AWS EC2 instance types. Instance types comprise of varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. While the resources allocated to system and Airflow components are managed by Astronomer, the node instance type you select for your Cluster powers the workers of all Deployments within that Cluster.

For detailed information on each instance type, refer to [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). If you're interested in a node type that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io). Not all instance types are supported in all AWS regions.

:::info

A single Cluster on Astro cannot currently be configured with more than one node instance type. In the first half of 2022, we expect to introduce support for Worker Queues, which will allow you to run workers of varying node types and sizes within a single Deployment. If this is something that your team is interested in, reach out to us. We'd love to hear from you.

:::

## Deployment Worker Size Limits

In addition to setting a node instance type for each Cluster, you can configure a unique worker size for each Deployment within a Cluster. Worker size can be specified at any time in the **Worker Resources** field in the Deployment view of the Cloud UI. You can select any worker size up to 400 AU (40 CPUs, 150 GiB memory) as long as the worker size is supported by the node instance type selected for the Cluster. When you attempt to provision a worker size that isn't supported by the Cluster instance type, an error message appears in the Cloud UI.

This table lists the maximum worker size that is supported on Astro for each node instance type. Maximum worker size values may increase or decrease over time as the system requirements of Astro change.

The maximum supported worker size on Astro is currently 400 AU, which means that an Astro Cluster may not make full use of the CPU and memory capacity of some node instance types on this list. If your team is interested in using an instance type that supports a worker size limit higher than 400 AU, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io). For more information on configuring worker size on Astro, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment.md#worker-resources).

:::info

The size limits defined here currently also apply to **Scheduler Resources**, which determines the CPU and memory allocated to the Airflow Scheduler(s) of each Deployment. The maximum Scheduler size on Astro is 30 AU, which means there are some node instance types for which that maximum size is not supported.

For more information about the Scheduler, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment.md#scheduler).

:::tip

With the exception of `m5d` nodes, all suppported node types have a maximum of 20GB of storage per node for system use only. If you need locally attached storage for task execution, Astronomer recommends modifying your cluster to run `m5d` nodes, which Astronomer provisions with NVMe SSD volumes.

Astronomer plans to support optional ephemeral storage for all node instance types in the first half of 2022.

If you need to pass significant data between Airflow tasks, Astronomer recommends using an [XCom backend](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html) such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage). For more information and best practices, see the Airflow Guide on [Passing Data Between Airflow Tasks](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks).
