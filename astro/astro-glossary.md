Each worker node pool has a worker type and a maximum node count.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Worker Queue             | A [worker queue](configure-worker-queues.md) is a set of configurations that apply to a group of workers in a Deployment running the Celery executor. Within a worker queue, users can configure worker type, worker size, and autoscaling behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Worker Type              | The worker type defines the quantity of resources a celery worker can consume. On Astro Hosted, worker types are defined in terms of Astronomer units (A5, A10, A20). Each Ax type has a different configuration for memory, cpu and default number of concurrent tasks per celery worker. On Astro Hybrid, worker types are defined by the cloud node instance type that host celery workers and KubernetesPodOperator pods.                        |
| Workspace                | [Workspaces](manage-workspaces.md) are collections of Deployments that can be accessed by a specific group of users. Workspaces can be used to group Deployments that share a business use case or environment trait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
