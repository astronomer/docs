As you develop data pipelines on Astro, we strongly recommend running and testing your DAGs locally before deploying your project to a Deployment on Astro. This document provides information about testing and troubleshooting DAGs in a local Apache Airflow environment with the Astro CLI.

## Run a project locally

To test your code, the first step is always to start a local Airflow environment. To run your project in a local Airflow environment, follow the steps in [Build and run a project](develop-project.md#build-and-run-a-project-locally).

## Test DAGs with the Astro CLI

To enhance the testing experience for data pipelines, Astro enables users to run DAG unit tests with two different Astro CLI commands:

- `astro dev parse`
- `astro dev pytest`

### Parse DAGs

To quickly parse your DAGs, you can run:

```sh
astro dev parse
```

This command parses your DAGs to ensure that they don't contain any basic syntax or import errors and that they can successfully render in the Airflow UI.

The command `astro dev parse` is a more convenient but less customizable version of `astro dev pytest`. If you don't have any specific test files that you want to run on your DAGs, Astronomer recommends using `astro dev parse` as your primary testing tool. For more information about this command, see the [CLI command reference](cli/astro-dev-parse.md).

### Run tests with pytest

To perform unit tests on your Astro project, you can run:

```sh
astro dev pytest
```

This command runs all tests in your project's `tests` directory with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/index.html#), a testing framework for Python. With pytest, you can test custom Python code and operators locally without having to start a local Airflow environment.

By default, the `tests` directory in your Astro project includes a default DAG integrity test called `test_dag_integrity.py`. This test checks that:

- All Airflow tasks have required arguments.
- DAG IDs are unique across the Astro project.
- DAGs have no cycles.
- There are no general import or syntax errors.

`astro dev pytest` runs this default test alongside any other custom tests that you add to the `tests` directory. For more information about this command, see the [CLI command reference](cli/astro-dev-pytest.md).

## View Airflow logs

You can use the Astro CLI to view logs for Airflow tasks and components from your local Airflow environment. This is useful if you want to troubleshoot a specific task instance, or if your environment suddenly stops working after a code change.

See [View logs](view-logs.md).

## Run Airflow CLI commands

To run [Apache Airflow CLI](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/cli-and-env-variables-ref.html) commands locally, run the following:

```sh
astro dev run <airflow-cli-command>
```

For example, the Airflow CLI command for listing connections is `airflow connections list`. To run this command with the Astro CLI, you would run `astro dev run connections list` instead.

Running `astro dev run` with the Astro CLI is the equivalent of running `docker exec` in local containers and then running an Airflow CLI command within those containers.

:::tip

You can only use `astro dev run` in a local Airflow environment. To automate Airflow actions on Astro, you can use the [Airflow REST API](airflow-api.md). For example, you can make a request to the [`dagRuns` endpoint](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/stable-rest-api-ref.html#operation/post_dag_run) to trigger a DAG run programmatically, which is equivalent to running `airflow dags trigger` in the Airflow CLI.

## Troubleshoot KubernetesPodOperator issues

View local Kubernetes logs to troubleshoot issues with Pods that are created by the operator. See [Test and Troubleshoot the KubernetesPodOperator Locally](kubepodoperator-local.md#step-4-view-kubernetes-logs).

## Hard reset your local environment

In most cases, [restarting your local project](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment) is sufficient for testing and making changes to your project. However, it is sometimes necessary to kill your Docker containers and metadata database for testing purposes. To do so, run the following command:

```sh
astro dev kill
```

This command forces your running containers to stop and deletes all data associated with your local Postgres metadata database, including Airflow connections, logs, and task history.

## Troubleshoot dependency errors

When dependency errors occur, the error message that is returned often doesn't contain enough information to help you resolve the error. To retrieve additional error information, you can review individual operating system or python package dependencies inside your local Docker containers.

For example, if your `packages.txt` file contains the openjdk-8-jdk, gcc, g++, or libsas12-dev packages and you receive build errors after running `astro dev start`, you can enter the container and install the packages manually to review additional information about the errors.

1. Run the following command to intialize a new `.astro` project:

    ```sh
    astro dev init
    ```

2. Run the following command to build your Astro project into a Docker image and start a local Docker container for each Airflow component:

    ```sh
      astro dev start
    ```

3. Run the following command to retrieve the container IDs:

    ```sh
      docker ps
    ```
4. Run the following command to open a bash terminal in a running container:

    ```sh
      docker exec -it -u 0 <container_id> /bin/bash
    ```
    Replace `container_id` with one of the IDs you retrieved in step 3.

5. Run the following command to download and install the prebuilt OpenJDK packages and review any error messages that are returned:

    ```bash
      apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    ```
6. Run the following command to install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler and review any error messages that are returned:

    ```bash
      apt-get install gcc
    ```
7. Run the following command to install the G++ compiler and review any error messages that are returned:

    ```bash
      apt-get install g++
    ```
 8. Run the following command to install the libsasl2-dev package and review any error messages that are returned:

    ```bash
      apt-get install libsasl2-dev
    ```
## Troubleshoot common issues

Use the information provided here to resolve common issues with running an Astro project in a local environment.

### New DAGs aren't visible in the Airflow UI

Make sure that no DAGs have duplicate `dag_id`s. When two DAGs use the same `dag_id`, the newest DAG won't appear in the Airflow UI and you won't receive an error message.

By default, the Airflow scheduler scans the `dags` directory of your Astro project for new files every 300 seconds (5 minutes). For this reason, it might take a few minutes for new DAGs to appear in the Airflow UI. Note that changes to existing DAGs appear immediately. To have the scheduler check for new DAGs more frequently, you can set the `AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__DAG_DIR_LIST_INTERVAL` environment variable to less than 300 seconds. Decreasing this setting results in the scheduler consuming more resources, so you might need to increase the CPU allocated to the scheduler.

### DAGs are running slowly

If your Astro project contains many DAGs or tasks, then you might experience performance issues in your local Airflow environment.

To improve the performance of your environment, you can:

 - Adjust CPU and memory resource allocation in your Docker configuration. Be aware that increasing Docker resource allocation might decrease the performance of your computer.
 - Modify Airflow-level environment variables, including concurrency and parallelism. See [Scaling out Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/airflow-scaling-workers).

Generating DAGs dynamically can also decrease the performance of your local Airflow environment, though it's a common authoring pattern for advanced use cases. For more information, see [Dynamically Generating DAGs in Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/dynamically-generating-dags/). If your DAGs continue to run slowly and you can't scale Docker or Airflow any further, Astronomer recommends pushing your project to a Deployment on Astro that's dedicated to testing.

:::tip

If you don't have enough Docker resources allocated to your local Airflow environment, you might see tasks fail and exit with this error:

   ```
   Task exited with return code Negsignal.SIGKILL
   ```

If you see this error, increase the CPU and memory allocated to Docker. If you're using Docker Desktop, you can do this by opening Docker Desktop and going to **Preferences** > **Resources** > **Advanced**. See [Change Docker Desktop preferences on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/).

### Astro project won't load after `astro dev start`

If you're running the Astro CLI on a Mac computer that's built with the Apple M1 chip, your Astro project might take more than 5 mins to start after running `astro dev start`. This is a current limitation of Astro Runtime and the Astro CLI that's expected to be addressed soon.

If your project won't load, it might also be because your webserver or scheduler is unhealthy. In this case, you might need to debug your containers. To do so:

1. After running `astro dev start`, retrieve a list of running containers by running `astro dev ps`.
2. If the webserver and scheduler containers exist but are unhealthy, check their logs by running:

    ```sh
    $ astro dev logs --webserver
    $ astro dev logs --scheduler
    ```
3. Optional. Run the following command to prune volumes and free disk space:

    ```sh
    docker system prune --volumes
    ```

These logs should help you understand why your webserver or scheduler is unhealthy. Possible reasons why these containers might be unhealthy include:

- Not enough Docker resources.
- A failed Airflow or Astro Runtime version upgrade.
- Misconfigured Dockerfile or Docker override file.
- Misconfigured Airflow settings.
