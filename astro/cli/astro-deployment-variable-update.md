:::info

This command is only available on Astro.

:::

For a given Deployment on Astro, use `astro deployment variable update` to update the value of an existing environment variable with the Astro CLI. To do so, you can either:

- Manually enter a new `key=value` pair for an existing key directly in the command.
- Modify the value of one or more environment variables in a `.env` file and load that file with `--load`.

This command is functionally identical to editing and saving the value of an existing environment variable in the Cloud UI. For more information on environment variables, see [Set environment variables on Astro](manage-env-vars.md).

## Usage

```sh
astro deployment variable update
```

:::tip

This command is recommended for automated workflows. To run this command in an automated process such as a [CI/CD pipeline](set-up-ci-cd.md), you can generate an API token, then specify the `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` environment variable in the system running the Astro CLI:

```bash
export ASTRO_API_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

See [Organization](organization-api-tokens.md), [Workspace](workspace-api-tokens.md), and [Deployment](deployment-api-tokens.md) API token documentation for more details about ways to use API tokens.

## Options

| Option                         | Description                                                                            | Possible Values                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-d`,`--deployment-id`           |       The ID of the Deployment whose environment variable(s) you want to update.                           | Any valid Deployment ID |
| `--deployment-name` | The name of the Deployment whose environment variable(s) you want to update. Use as an alternative to `<deployment-id>`. | Any valid Deployment name                                            |
| `-e`,`--env`                  | The path to a file that contains a list of environment variables.  If a filepath isn't specified, this looks for a `.env` file in your current directory. If `.env` doesn't exist, this flag will create it for you                                                                 | Any valid filepath       |
| `-l`,`--load`    | Export updated environment variables from your Astro project's `.env` file to the Deployment. This is an alternative to updating an environment variable by manually specifying `--key` and `--value`. By default, this flag updates all environment variables based on the file specified with `--env`            |`` |
| `-s`,`--secret`    | Set the value of the updated environment variable as secret      |`` |
| `-w`,`--workspace-id`          | Update an environment variable for a Deployment that is not in your current Workspace. If this is not specified, your current Workspace is assumed           | Any valid Workspace ID

## Examples

```sh
# Update an existing environment variable and set as secret
$ astro deployment variable update --deployment-id cl03oiq7d80402nwn7fsl3dmv AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS=<my-new-secret-value> --secret

# Update multiple environment variables for a Deployment at once by loading them from a .env file
$ astro deployment variable update --deployment-id cl03oiq7d80402nwn7fsl3dmv --load --env .env.dev
```
