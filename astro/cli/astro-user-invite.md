## Usage

```sh
astro user invite <user-email> <flags>
```

## Options

| Option              | Description                                                                                   | Possible Values                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-r`, `--role` | Force the user to manually access the Cloud UI to log in instead of opening the browser automatically from the CLI.           | `ORGANIZATION_MEMBER`, `ORGANIZATION_BILLING_ADMIN`, `ORGANIZATION_OWNER`|

## Examples

```sh
$ astro user invite
# CLI prompts you for a user's email and assigns them the `ORGANIZATION_MEMBER` role by default

$ astro user invite user@company.com --role ORGANIZATION_BILLING_ADMIN
# Invite a user as an Organization Billing Admin
```
