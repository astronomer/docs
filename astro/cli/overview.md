## Build, Run, and Observe Airflow Locally

The open source Astro CLI makes it easy to develop an Airflow project and run it on your local machine. It automatically manages Airflow resources and components so that you can focus on development, not configuration.

## Manage Astro From Your Terminal

The Astro CLI also functions as a core tool for deploying Airflow at scale with [Astro](https://www.astronomer.io/product/). Using the Astro CLI, you can:

- Manage user permissions in Astro Workspaces and Deployments.
- Automatically deploy code to Astro via CI/CD.
- Access logs for Airflow components running in your cloud.

## Quickstart

Follow the [Astro CLI Quickstart](cli-quickstart.md) to install the CLI and run your first locally hosted Airflow project.

## CLI Reference

For a full list of available CLI commands, see the [CLI Command Reference](cli-reference.md).
