Switch to a different Organization that you have access to in Astro.

## Usage

```sh
astro organization switch <your-organization-name-or-id>
```

You can switch to a different Organization only if you have already authenticated to your primary Organization using `astro login`. If you have not authenticated, run `astro login <base-domain>` first.

Switching to a different organization triggers a new browser login. If browser login does not work on your machine, use the `--login-link` flag with `organization switch`.
