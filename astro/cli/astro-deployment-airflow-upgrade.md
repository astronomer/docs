:::info

This command is available only if you're authenticated to an Astronomer Software installation.

:::

Initializes the Airflow version upgrade process on any Airflow Deployment on Astronomer. See [Upgrade Airflow on Astronomer Software](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/software/manage-airflow-versions)

## Usage

Run `astro deployment airflow upgrade --deployment-id` to initialize the Airflow upgrade process. To finalize the Airflow upgrade process, complete all of the steps in [Upgrade Airflow on Astronomer Software](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/software/manage-airflow-versions).

If you do not specify `--desired-airflow-version`, this command creates a list of available Airflow versions that you can select. The Astro CLI lists only the available Airflow versions that are later than the version currently specified in your `Dockerfile`.
