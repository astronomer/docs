Delete the locally stored information for a given Astronomer installation or base domain. After running this command, the domain for the installation that you specify will no longer appear when you run `astro context list`, and you will not be able to use `astro context switch` to switch to the installation.

If you re-authenticate to an installation that you previously deleted with this command, its information will again be available from `astro context list` and `astro context switch`.

## Usage

```sh
astro context delete <basedomain>
```
