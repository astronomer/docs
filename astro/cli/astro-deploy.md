:::info

The behavior and format of this command differs depending on what Astronomer product you're using. Use the following tabs to change between product contexts.

[Deploy code](deploy-code.md) to a Deployment on Astro.

This command bundles all files in your Astro project and pushes them to Astro. Before completing the process, it tests your DAGs in your Astro project for errors. If this test fails, the deploy to Astro will also fail. This is the same test which runs locally with `astro dev parse`.

When you run `astro deploy`, the CLI prompts you to select from a list of all Deployments that you can access across Workspaces. To bypass this prompt, you can also specify a Deployment ID in the command. To retrieve a Deployment ID, open your Deployment in the Astro UI and copy the value in the **ID** section of the Deployment page. You can also run `astro deployment list` to find a Deployment ID or name.

For teams operating at scale, this command can be automated with a [CI/CD pipeline](set-up-ci-cd.md) by using [Deployment API tokens](deployment-api-tokens.md) in the request. When `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` is specified as OS-level environment variables on your local machine or in a CI tool, `astro deploy <deployment-id>` can be run without requiring user authentication.

:::tip

To skip the parsing process before deploys, complete one of the following setups:

- Add `skip_parse: true` to `.astro/config.yaml` in your Astro project.
- Add `ASTRONOMER_SKIP_PARSE=true` as an environment variable to your local environment or CI/CD pipeline.

## Usage

astro deploy <options>

[Deploy code](deploy-code.md) to a Deployment on Astronomer Software.

This command bundles all files in your Astro project and pushes them to Astronomer Software.

When you run `astro deploy`, you'll be prompted to select from a list of all Deployments that you can access in all Workspaces. To bypass this prompt, you can specify a Deployment ID in the command. To retrieve a Deployment ID, go to your Deployment's information page in the Astro UI and copy the value after the last `/` in the URL. You can also run `astro deployment list` to retrieve a Deployment ID .

| `--build-secrets` | Run `docker build --secret` to mount a secret value to your Docker image. | `id=<your-secret-id>, src=<path-to-secret> .` See [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/#secret-mounts). |
| `-f`,`--force`            | Force deploy even if your project contains errors or uncommitted changes           | None                    |
| `-p`,`--prompt`           | Force the Deployment selection prompt even if a Deployment ID is specified         | None                    |
| `-s`,`--save`             | Save the current Deployment and working directory combination for future deploys   | None                    |
| `--no-cache`              | Do not use any images from the container engine's cache when building your project | None                    |
| `--workspace-id <string>` | In the prompt to select a Deployment, only show Deployments within this Workspace  | Any valid Workspace ID  |

## Examples

```sh
# List of Deployments appears
$ astro deploy

# Deploy directly to a specific Deployment
$ astro deploy ckvvfp9tf509941drl4vela81n

# The CLI automatically selects this Deployment for your Astro project
$ astro deploy ckvvfp9tf509941drl4vela81n --save

:::info

The following error can sometimes occur when the CLI tries to build your Astro Runtime image using Podman:

```bash
WARN[0010] SHELL is not supported for OCI image format, [/bin/bash -o pipefail -e -u -x -c] will be ignored. Must use `docker` format
```

You can resolve this issue by exporting the `BUILDAH_FORMAT` [environment variable](astro/environment-variables.md) to Podman:

```dockerfile
export BUILDAH_FORMAT=docker
```
