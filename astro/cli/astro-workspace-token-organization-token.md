:::info

This command is only available on Astro.

:::

To centralize API token management, you can add an Organization token to a Workspace instead of creating a dedicated Workspace API token. Workspace-scoped API tokens are useful if you want to manage API tokens from the Organization level on a single screen, or you want to use a single API token for multiple Workspaces

There are four sub-commands for managing a Workspace-scoped Organization token:

## `astro workspace organization-token add`

## `astro workspace organization-token list`

## `astro workspace organization-token remove`

## `astro workspace organization-token update`
