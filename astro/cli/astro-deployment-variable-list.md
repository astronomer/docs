For a given Deployment on Astro, list its running environment variables in your terminal. To test these environment variables locally without having to manually copy them, you can also use this command to save them in a local `.env` file.

If an existing `.env` file already exists in your current directory, `--save` will append environment variables to the bottom of that file. It will not override or replace its contents. If `.env` does not exist, `--save` will create the file for you.

If an environment variable value is set as secret, the CLI will list only its key.

## Usage

```sh
astro deployment variable list
```

:::tip

To run this command in an automated process such as a [CI/CD pipeline](ci-cd.md), set the following OS-level environment variables in a way that the Astro CLI can access them:

- `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID`
- `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`

After setting the variables, this command works for a Deployment without you having to manually authenticate to Astronomer. Astronomer recommends storing `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` as a secret before using it to programmatically update production-level Deployments.

$ astro deployment variable list --deployment-id cl03oiq7d80402nwn7fsl3dmv --save

# Save only a single environment variable from a Deployment on Astro to a `.env` file that is outside of your current directory
$ astro deployment variable list --deployment-name="My Deployment" --key AIRFLOW__CORE__PARALLELISM --save --env /users/documents/my-astro-project/.env
