:::info

This command is only available on Astro.

:::

Copy Airflow connections from one Astro Deployment to another. Airflow connections are stored in the target Deployment's metadata database and appear in the Airflow UI.

## Usage

```sh
astro deployment connection copy
```

This command only copies Airflow connections that were configured through the Airflow UI or otherwise stored in the Airflow metadata database.

:::tip

This command is recommended for automated workflows. To run this command in an automated process such as a [CI/CD pipeline](set-up-ci-cd.md), you can generate an API token, then specify the `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` environment variable in the system running the Astro CLI:

```bash
export ASTRO_API_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

See [Organization](organization-api-tokens.md), [Workspace](workspace-api-tokens.md), and [Deployment](deployment-api-tokens.md) API token documentation for more details about ways to use API tokens.
