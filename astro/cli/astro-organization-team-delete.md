Delete a Team from your Organization.

## Usage

astro organization team delete <team-id>

To find a Team ID using the Astro CLI, run `astro organization team list`.

To find a Team ID in the Cloud UI, click your Workspace name in the upper left corner, then click **Organization Settings** > **Access Management** > **Teams**. Search for your Team in the **Teams** table and copy its **ID**. The ID should look something like `clk17xqgm124q01hkrgilsr49`.
