Unless otherwise specified, new Clusters on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are created with a set of default resources that our team has deemed appropriate for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported cluster configurations.

## Supported cluster configurations

Depending on the needs of your team, you may be interested in modifying certain configurations of a new or existing cluster on Astro. This section provides a reference for which configuration options are supported during the install process.

To create a new cluster on Astro with a specified configuration, read [Install on GCP](install-gcp.md) or [Create a cluster](create-cluster.md). For instructions on how to make a change to an existing cluster, see [Modify a cluster](modify-cluster.md).

Modifying the region of an existing Astro cluster isn't supported. If you're interested in a GCP region that isn't on this list, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

### Worker node pools

Node pools are a scalable collection of worker nodes with the same instance type. These nodes are responsible for running the Pods that execute Airflow tasks. If your cluster has a node pool for a specific instance type, you can configure tasks to run on those instance types using [worker queues](configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues). To make an instance type available in a cluster, reach out to [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support) with a request to create a new node pool for the specific instance type. Note that not all machine types are supported in all GCP regions.

Astronomer monitors your usage and number of nodes deployed in your cluster. As your usage of Airflow increases, Astronomer might reach out with recommendations for updating your node pools to optimize your infrastructure spend or increase the efficiency of your tasks.

### Worker node size resource reference

Each worker node in a pool runs a single worker Pod. A worker Pod's actual available size is equivalent to the total capacity of the instance type minus Astroâ€™s system overhead.

The following table lists all available instance types for worker node pools, as well as the Pod size that is supported for each instance type. As the system requirements of Astro change, these values can increase or decrease.

| Node Instance Type | CPU       | Memory       |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------|
| e2-standard-4      | 2 CPUs    | 7.5  GiB MEM |
| e2-standard-8      | 6 CPUs    | 22.5 GiB MEM |

If your Organization is interested in using an instance type that supports a larger worker size, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). For more information about configuring worker size on Astro, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment-resources.md).

### Maximum node count

Each Astro cluster has a limit on how many nodes it can run at once. This maximum includes worker nodes as well as system nodes managed by Astronomer.

The default maximum node count for all nodes across your cluster is 20. A cluster's node count is most affected by the number of worker Pods that are executing Airflow tasks. See [Worker autoscaling logic](configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-autoscaling-logic).

If the node count for your cluster reaches the maximum node count, new tasks might not run or get scheduled. Astronomer monitors maximum node count and is responsible for contacting your organization if it is reached. To check your cluster's current node count, contact [Astronomer Support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).
