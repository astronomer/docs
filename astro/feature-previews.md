Astronomer shares feature previews to give customers a chance to evaluate and provide feedback on features before they are generally available (GA). This document defines those feature preview stages, and the levels of availability, support, and customer access granted at each stage.

To view the support commitment for GA releases of Astro Runtime, see [Astro Runtime maintenance and lifecycle policy](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.mdx). To submit feedback or a support request for a Public or Private Preview feature, see [Submit a support request](astro-support.md).
