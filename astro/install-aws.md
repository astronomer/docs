This is where you'll find instructions for completing the Astro installation process, including prerequisites and the steps required to allow Astronomer support to provision resources in your network.

To install Astro on AWS, you'll complete the following tasks:
- Create an account on Astro.
- Share AWS account information with Astronomer support.
- Create a cross-account IAM role that Astro can assume within your new AWS account.

Astronomer will then create a cluster within your AWS account that hosts the resources and Apache Airflow components necessary to deploy DAGs and execute tasks. If you'd like to support more than 1 Astro cluster, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

For a complete list of the AWS resources that Astronomer support provisions in your AWS account, see [Resource usage](resource-reference-aws.md).

## Prerequisites

- A dedicated AWS account with minimum EC2 service quotas.
- An AWS IAM user with the following permissions:
    - `cloudformation:*`
    - `GetRole`
    - `GetRolePolicy`
    - `CreateRole`
    - `DeleteRolePolicy`
    - `PutRolePolicy`
    - `ListRoles`
    - `UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`

   See [Creating an administrator IAM user and user group (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html#getting-started_create-admin-group-console).
- A subscription to the [Astro Status Page](https://status.astronomer.io/). This will ensure that you're alerted in the case of an incident or scheduled maintenance.
- The following domains added to your organization's allowlist for any user and CI/CD environments:
    - `https://cloud.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://astro-<your-org>.datakin.com/`
    - `https://<your-org>.astronomer.run/`
    - `https://api.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://images.astronomer.cloud/`
    - `https://auth.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://updates.astronomer.io/`
    - `https://install.astronomer.io/`

Astro requires a clean AWS account with a minimum set of EC2 service quotas. For security reasons, the install process is not currently supported on an AWS account that has other tooling running in it. For instructions on creating a new AWS account, follow [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

The required [EC2 service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) are:

| QuotaCode  | QuotaName                                                        | Minimum Value  |
| -----------| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------|
| L-1216C47A | Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances | 40             |
| L-34B43A08 | All Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Spot Instance Requests  | 40             |

These are required to mitigate near term capacity risks and ensure a smooth onboarding experience on Astro. If you need to modify or increase a specific quota, see Amazonâ€™s documentation on [requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html).

Once your AWS account is created, proceed to Step 1.

:::tip

If you have one or more existing AWS accounts, you can use [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) to manage billing, users, and more in a central place. For more information on how to add your Astro AWS account to your AWS Organization, read [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html).
:::

### VPC peering prerequisites (Optional)

If any AWS resources are on a private network, you can choose between two options:

- Allow traffic via the public internet and use allow-lists for communication.
- Create a VPC Peering connection between Astronomer's VPC and the VPCs for your broader network.

If you want to continue with the second option, you'll additionally need:

- A CIDR block (RFC 1918 IP Space) no smaller than a `/19` range. You must ensure it does not overlap with the AWS VPC(s) that you will be peering with later. The default CIDR range is `172.20.0.0/19`.
- VPC Name / ID for peering with Astronomer (accessible through the [AWS VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)).
- The IP addresses of your DNS servers.

## Step 1: Access Astro

Go to https://cloud.astronomer.io/ and create an account.

When you first authenticate to Astro, you can sign in to the Cloud UI with a Google account, a GitHub account, or an email and password.

![Astro login screen](/img/docs/login.png)

If you're the first person from your Organization to authenticate, Astronomer support will add you as a Workspace Admin to a new Workspace named after your Organization. From there, you'll be able to add other team members to that Workspace without the assistance of Astronomer support.

:::tip

After completing your initial installation, Astronomer recommends [setting up an identity provider (IdP)](configure-idp.md) so that users can log in to Astro through your IdP.

:::

## Step 2: Retrieve an external ID from the Cloud UI

In the Cloud UI, open the **Settings** tab and copy the value in **AWS EXTERNAL ID**. This external ID is a unique identifier that Astro uses to connect to your AWS account. Save the external ID as a secret or in another secure format. See [How to use an external ID when granting access to your AWS resources to a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

You must be an Organization Owner to view the external ID. If you are not an Organization Owner, the field will not appear in the Cloud UI.

## Step 3: Create a cross-account IAM role for Astro

Use the external ID you saved from Step 2 to create a cross-account IAM role for Astro. Astronomer recommends using the AWS Management Console to create the role.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="managementconsole"
    groupId= "step-3-create-a-cross-account-iam-role-for-astro"
    values={[
        {label: 'AWS Management Console', value: 'managementconsole'},
        {label: 'AWS Command Line', value: 'commandline'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="managementconsole">

1. Open the [Astronomer cross-account role CloudFormation template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://astro-cross-account-role-template.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/customer-account.yaml&stackName=AstroCrossAccountIAMRole&param_AstroAccountId=406882777402).

2. Enter the external ID that you copied in Step 2 in the **ExternalId** field.

3. Select the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names** checkbox.

4. Click **Create Stack**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="commandline">

1. Open the AWS CLI and run the following command to create a cross-account IAM Role:

    ```bash
    $ aws iam create-role --role-name astronomer-remote-management --assume-role-policy-document "{
        \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",
        \"Statement\": [
            {
                \"Effect\": \"Allow\",
                \"Principal\": {
                    \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::406882777402:root\"
                },
                \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",
                \"Condition\": {
                    \"StringEquals\": {
                    \"sts:ExternalId\": \"$EXTERNAL_ID\"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }"
    ```

2. Run the following command to attach a managed policy to the Astronomer remote management role.

    ```bash
    $ aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --role-name astronomer-remote-management
    ```
    This command returns a YAML file containing role information:

    ```yaml
    {
      "Role":
        {
          "Path": "/",
          "RoleName": "astronomer-remote-management",
          "RoleId": "AROAZZTAM6QSYIFGCB37R",
          "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::673438299173:role/astronomer-remote-management",
          "CreateDate": "2021-06-30T17:47:39+00:00",
          "AssumeRolePolicyDocument":
            {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement":
                [
                  {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::406882777402:root" },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                    "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "sts:ExternalId": "" } },
                  },
                ],
            },
        },
    }
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To provision additional Clusters after completing your initial installation, see [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.md).

:::caution

Some AWS regions that Astronomer supports are disabled by default on AWS, including:
- `ap-east-1` - Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
- `me-south-1` - Middle East (Bahrain)

If you're setting up your first cluster in any of these regions, you need to complete the additional setup described in [Create a cluster](create-cluster.md#additional-setup-for-aws-regions-that-are-disabled-by-default).

:::

## Step 4: Provide setup information to Astronomer

After creating the AWS account, provide Astronomer support with the following information:

- Your AWS Account ID.
- Your preferred Astro cluster name.
- The AWS region that you want to host your cluster in.
- Your preferred node instance type.
- Your preferred maximum node count.

If you do not specify configuration preferences, Astronomer creates a cluster with `m5.xlarge` nodes and a maximum node count of 20 in `us-east-1`. For information on all supported regions, configurations, and defaults, see [Resources required for Astro on AWS](resource-reference-aws.md).

## Step 5: Wait for Astronomer to complete the install

After you've created the cross-account IAM role for Astro, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). Astronomer support will finish creating the cluster in your AWS account.

This process can take some time. Wait for confirmation that the installation was successful before proceeding to the next step.

> **Note**: If you need to VPC peer with Astronomer, additionally provide the following information to your Astronomer representative:
>
>- Subnet CIDRs (RFC 1918 IP Space).
>- VPC Name/ID and region for peering with Astronomer. This is accessible through the [AWS VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).
>- The IPs of your DNS servers.
>
> You then need to accept a VPC peering request from Astronomer after Astro is installed. To accept the request, follow [Creating and accepting a VPC peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html) in AWS documentation.
>
> Once VPC peered with Astronomer, configure and validate the following to ensure successful network communications between Astro and your resources:
>
>- Egress Routes on Astronomer Route Table
>- [Network ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html#nacl-tasks) and/or [Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#working-with-security-groups) rules of your resources

## Step 6: Create a Deployment

When Astronomer confirms that your Astro cluster has been created, you are ready to create a Deployment and start deploying DAGs. Log in to [the Cloud UI](https://cloud.astronomer.io) again and [create a new Deployment](create-deployment.md). If the installation is successful, your new Astro cluster is listed as an option below the **Cluster** menu:

![Cloud UI New Deployment screen](/img/docs/create-new-deployment-select-cluster.png)

## Next steps

Now that you have an Astro cluster up and running, take a look at the docs below for information on how to start working in Astro:
