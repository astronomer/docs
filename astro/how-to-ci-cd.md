Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are programmatic workflows that automate key parts of the software development lifecycle, including code changes, builds, and testing. CI/CD enables teams to develop faster, more securely, and more reliably.

On Astro, you can use Deployment API keys to automate your code deploys. Astronomer recommends hosting your Astro project source code in a version control tool and setting up a CI/CD workflow for all production environments.

There are many benefits to configuring a CI/CD workflow on Astro. Specifically, you can:

- Avoid manually running `astro deploy` every time you make a change to your Astro project.
- Ensure that all changes to your Astro project are reviewed and approved by your team before they get pushed to Astro.
- Automate promoting code across development and production environments on Astro when pull requests to certain branches are merged.
- Enforce automated testing, which increases code quality and allows your team to respond quickly in case of an error or failure.
- Configure more granular user permissions by managing access and changes to your Astro project source code in your version control tool.

There are many strategies for organizing your source code and building CI/CD pipelines, and each has its own benefits and limitations. Use this document to determine what kind of CI/CD system you want to support, then see [CI/CD templates](ci-cd.md) for setup steps and examples.

# Prerequisites


## Chose a Deployment strategy

You can set up CI/CD pipelines to manage multiple Deployments and repositories based on your team structure. The most common strategies are: 

- Single Git repository to a single Deployment
- Multiple Git repositories to a single Deployment
- S3 bucket and Git repository to a single Deployment

Read the following topics to learn which strategy is right for you. 

### Single Git repository to a single Deployment

To deploy code from a single Git repository to an Astro Deployment with CI/CD, you store a complete Astro project in your Git repository and use Astro CLI commands to push the code from the repository to a Deployment. Whenever you push code to your GitHub repository, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered and pushes the code changes from your repository to Astro.

classDef astro fill:#dbcdf6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
id1[Local Astro project]-->|Push code change|id2[Git repository]
id2-->|Deploy through CI/CD| id3[Astro Deployment]
``

Using a single repository lets you quickly check and manage you Astro project in a single place. This strategy is recommended for most teams. 


## Multiple Git repositories to a single Deployment

Using multi-repository CI/CD strategy, you can manage the DAGs in one repository and project settings in another. Use this strategy to ensure that DAG authors and data operators have access only to their own files. 

``mermaid
flowchart LR;
classDef subgraph_padding fill:none,stroke:none
classDef astro fill:#dbcdf6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
id1[Admin's local Astro project]-->|Push project changes|id5[Git repository]
id4[DAG author's local Astro project]-->|Push DAG changes|id2[Git repository]
subgraph 1[CI/CD pipeline]
    id5-->|Full project deploy|id3
    id2-->|DAG-only deploy| id3[Astro Deployment]
    end
``

One drawback to this strategy is that you must keep any local copies of the Astro project in sync with both repositories in order to test Deployment code locally. Your team members might have inconsistencies in their local environments if they can't access code changes from other team members. Astronomer recommends setting up a `dev` Deployment that your users have more access to for testing purposes. 

This strategy requires enabling [DAG-only deploys](deploy-code.md#enable-dag-only-deploys-on-a-deployment) on the target Deployment and setting up your CI/CD pipeline on both Git repositories.

### S3 bucket and Git repository to a single Deployment

Similarly to the multiple repository strategy, this strategy separates the management of DAGs and project configuration. DAGs are stored in an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), while Astro project configuration files are stored in a Git repository. 

``mermaid
flowchart LR;
classDef subgraph_padding fill:none,stroke:none
classDef astro fill:#dbcdf6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
id1[Admin's local Astro project]-->|Push project changes|id5[Git repository]
id4[DAG author's local Astro project]-->|Push DAG changes|id2[S3 bucket]
id2-->|"DAG-only deploy </br>(Lambda function)" | id3[Astro Deployment]
id5-->|"Full project deploy </br> (CI/CD)"|id3
``

If you migrated to Astro from MWAA, this strategy is useful for maintaining a similar workflow for users. You can set up a Lambda function to push DAGs to your Astronomer Deployment whenever DAG files are updated in your specific S3 bucket.

## Create a CI/CD pipeline

The general process for creating an Astro CI/CD template is to:

- Decide on a CI/CD strategy based on this document and your team's needs.
- Set up your repositories and permissions based on your CI/CD strategy.
- Add one of Astronomer's [CI/CD templates](ci-cd.md) to your repositories, or use the Astronomer-maintained [`deploy-action` GitHub action](https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action).
- Modify the template or GitHub action as needed for your use case. 

If you use GitHub, Astronomer strongly recommends using the Astronomer-maintained [`deploy-action` GitHub action](https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action).(https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action).


# Testing and Validating DAGs During CI/CD

You may consider validating and testing your DAG code before deploying it to your Deployment.

Astronomer provides [tooling](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/test-and-troubleshoot-locally#test-dags-with-the-astro-cli) to validate that your DAGs do not have import or syntax errors. You can implement this parse test with the [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/astro-dev-parse) or the [Deploy-Action](https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action). The default test may not work on all DAGs, especially if they access the meta-database at runtime (a common anti-pattern). In this case, you can write your own parse test using our example pytests.

Astronomer also provides tooling to run [custom Pytests](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/best-practices.html#unit-tests) on your DAG code, python methods, and custom operators. The [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/astro-dev-pytest) and [Deploy-Action](https://github.com/astronomer/deploy-action#example-using-pytests) will use docker to spin up a docker container that has a similar environment to your deployment and executes your Pytests. We recommend that you pytest any custom python code you use in your DAGs.
