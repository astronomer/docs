As a Workspace Admin or Organization Owner, you can add new team members to Astro and grant them user roles with permissions for specific actions across your Organization. Workspace Admins can remove users from a Workspace, and Organization Owners can remove users from an Organization.

## Prerequisites

- To add, edit, or remove Organization users, you need Organization Owner permissions.
- To add edit, or remove Workspace users, you need Workspace Admin permissions for a given Workspace. The user must also already be a part of the Organization that hosts the Workspace.
- To remove yourself from an Organization as an Organization Owner, one or more Organization Owners must be assigned to the Organization. If you're the only Organization Owner for your Organization, you'll need to assign another Organization Owner before removing yourself from the Organization.

For more information on user roles, see [Manage user permissions on Astro](user-permissions.md).

## Add a user to an Organization

If your Organization has a configured identity provider, then by default anyone who has an email from a domain that you manage can join your Organization as an Organization Member without an invite. See [Configure just-in-time provisioning for single sign-on](manage-organization.md#configure-just-in-time-provisioning-for-single-sign-on).

If you want to invite a user to an Organization from a domain that you don't own, such as a third party consultant, or you want to invite someone from your company to Astro with a higher level role, follow these steps.

1. In the Cloud UI Organization view, click the **People** tab.

2. Click **Invite member**:

3. Enter the user's email.

4. Set an Organization role for the user. See [User permissions](user-permissions.md).

5. Click **Add member**.

    After you add the user, their information appears in the **Access** tab as a new entry in the **Members** table. To access the Organization, the user needs to accept the invitation sent by email and then create an Astro account or log in.

## Update or remove an Organization user

See [User permissions](user-permissions.md) to view the permissions for each available Organization role.

1. In the Cloud UI, click the **People** tab.
   
2. Find the user in the **Members** list and then click **Edit**.
   
3. Optional. Edit the user's role. See [User permissions](user-permissions.md). 
   
4. If you updated the user's role, click **Update member**. To delete the user, click **Remove member**.
