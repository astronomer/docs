## Overview

This guide provides steps for adding a user to an Astro Workspace. As a Workspace Admin or Organization Owner, you can add new team members to Astro and grant them user roles with permissions for specific actions across your Organization.

## Prerequisites

To add a user to Astro, you must have at least one of the following permissions:

- If you're inviting a user to your Organization, you need Organization Owner permissions.
- If you're inviting a user to a specific Workspace, you need Workspace Admin permissions.

## Add a User to a Workspace

To add a user to a Workspace:

1. In the Cloud UI, open your Workspace and go to the **Access** tab.
2. Click **Add member**:

3. Enter the user's email.
4. Set a Workspace role for the user. For a list of available roles and their permissions, see [Workspace Roles](user-permissions.md#workspace-roles)
5. Click **Add member**.

Once you add the user, their information will appear in the **Access** tab as a new entry in the **Members** table. The user will then need to accept an invite to the Workspace via email before they have access to it in the Cloud UI.

## Add a User to an Organization

To add a user to an Organization:

1. In the Cloud UI's Organization view, open the **People** tab.
2. Click **Invite member**:
