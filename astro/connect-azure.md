Use this document to learn how you can grant an Astro cluster and its Deployments access to your external Azure resources.

Publicly accessible endpoints allow you to quickly connect your Astro clusters or Deployments to Azure through an Apache AirflowÂ® connection. If your cloud restricts IP addresses, you can add the external IPs of your Deployment or cluster to an Azure resource's allowlist.

If you have stricter security requirements, you can [create a private connection](#create-a-private-connection-between-astro-and-azure) to Azure in a few different ways.

After you create a connection from your cluster to Azure, you might also need to individually authorize Deployments to access specific resources. See [Authorize your Deployment using workload identity](authorize-deployments-to-your-cloud.md).

## Standard and dedicated cluster support for Azure networking

Standard clusters have different connection options than dedicated clusters.

Standard clusters can connect to Azure in the following ways:

- Using [static external IP addresses](#allowlist-a-deployments-external-ip-addresses-on-azure).

Dedicated clusters can also connect to Azure using static IP addresses. Additionally, they support a number of private connectivity options including:

- VNet peering
- Azure Private Link

If you require a private connection between Astro and Azure, Astronomer recommends configuring a dedicated cluster. See [Create a dedicated cluster](create-dedicated-cluster.md).

## Access a public Azure endpoint

All Astro clusters include a set of external IP addresses that persist for the lifetime of the cluster. When you create a Deployment in your workspace, Astro assigns it one of these external IP addresses. To facilitate communication between Astro and your cloud, you can allowlist these external IPs in your cloud. If you have no other security restrictions, this means that any cluster with an allowlisted external IP address can access your Azure resources through a valid Airflow connection.

### Allowlist a Deployment's external IP addresses on Azure

1. In the Astro UI, select a Workspace, click **Deployments**, and then select a Deployment.
2. Select the **Details** tab.
3. In the **Other** section, you can find the **External IPs** associated with the Deployment.
4. Add the IP addresses to the allowlist of any external services that you want your Deployment to access.

When you use publicly accessible endpoints to connect to Azure, traffic moves directly between your Astro cluster and the Azure API endpoint. Data in this traffic never reaches the Astronomer managed control plane. Note that you still might also need to authorize your Deployment to some resources before it can access them. For example, you can [Authorize deployments to your cloud with workload identity](authorize-deployments-to-your-cloud.md) so that you can avoid adding passwords or other access credentials to your Airflow connections.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Dedicated cluster external IP addresses</strong></summary>

If you use Dedicated clusters and want to allowlist external IP addresses at the cluster level instead of at the Deployment level, you can find the list cluster-level external IP addresses in your **Organization settings**.

1. In the Astro UI, click your Workspace name in the upper left corner, then click **Organization Settings**.
2. Click **Clusters**, then select a cluster.
3. In the Details page, copy the IP addresses listed under **External IPs**.
4. Add the IP addresses to the allowlist of any external services that you want your cluster to access. You can also access these IP addresses from the **Details** page of any Deployment in the cluster.

After you allowlist a cluster's IP addresses, all Deployments in that cluster have network connectivity to Azure.

## Create a private connection between Astro and Azure

The option that you choose is determined by the security requirements of your company and your existing infrastructure.

<TabItem value="VNet peering">

:::info

This connection option is only available for dedicated Astro Hosted clusters and Astro Hybrid.

:::

To set up a private connection between an Astro Virtual Network (VNet) and an Azure VNet, you can create a VNet peering connection. VNet peering ensures private and secure connectivity, reduces network transit costs, and simplifies network layouts.

1. Retrieve the following information from the target Azure environment that you want to connect with:

    - Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID.
    - VNet ID.
    - Resource Group ID.

2. Prepare the `astro-vnet-peering-creator-role.json` JSON file with the following permissions. Replace `{customer-subscription-id}` with your value:

    ```sh
    {
        "Name": "Astro VNET Peering Contributor",
        "IsCustom": true,
        "Description": "Can create VNET peering with Astro.",
        "Actions": [
            "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
            "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/write",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/peer/action",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/write",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/read"
        ],
        "NotActions": [
      
        ],
        "AssignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/{customer-subscription-id}"
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Run the following Azure CLI commands to give Astronomer support temporary permissions to establish a VNet peering connection:

    ```sh
    # Add Astronomer Service Principal
    az ad sp create --id a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0
    
    # Create a Custom role with permissions prepared in previous step
    az role definition create --role-definition ~/astro-vnet-peering-creator-role.json

    # Assign Custom role to the Astronomer Service Principal ({customer-subscription-id} has to be replaced with your value)
    az role assignment create \
    --assignee a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0 \
    --role "Astro VNET Peering Contributor" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/{customer-subscription-id}"

    # Verify an assignment
    az role assignment list --assignee a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0 --all -o table
    ```

4. Contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/open-support-request) to tell them that you granted permissions to the Astronomer Service Principal. In addition, provide the following details in your request:

    - Astro Cluster ID 
    - Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID of the target VNet
    - Resource group ID
    - VNet ID for the peering

After receiving your request, Astronomer support creates a VNet peering connection between the two VNets. No other actions are required from you. Astronomer support will notify you when the connection is ready to use.

When the network connection is confirmed, you can delete the temporary roles you created using the following command. Replace `{customer-subscription-id}` with your value:

    ```sh
    az role assignment delete --assignee a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0 --role "Astro VNET Peering Contributor" --scope "/subscriptions/{customer-subscription-id}"
    ```

<TabItem value="VHub peering">

:::info
This connection option is only available for dedicated Astro Hosted clusters and Astro Hybrid.
:::

To set up a private connection between an Astro Virtual Network (VNet) and an Azure VHub, you can create a VHub peering connection. VHub peering ensures private and secure connectivity, reduces network transit costs, and attaches the Astro environment to a centralized managed network.

1. Retrieve the following information from the target Azure environment that you want to connect with:

    - Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID.
    - VHub name.
    - Resource Group ID.
    - Optional. Firewall IP address if you use any on the VHub side.

2. Prepare a `astro-vhub-peering-creator-role.json` JSON file with the following permissions. Replace `{customer-subscription-id}` with your value:

    ```sh
    {
        "Name": "Astro VHub Peering Contributor",
        "IsCustom": true,
        "Description": "Can create VNET peering with Astro.",
        "Actions": [
            "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
            "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualHubs/hubVirtualNetworkConnections/write",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualHubs/read",
            "Microsoft.Network/virtualWans/virtualHubs/read"
        ],
        "NotActions": [
      
        ],
        "AssignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/{customer-subscription-id}"
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Run the following Azure CLI commands to give Astronomer Support temporary permissions to establish a VHub peering connection:

    ```sh
    # Add Astronomer Service Principal
    az ad sp create --id a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0
    
    # Create a Custom role with permissions prepared in previous step
    az role definition create --role-definition ~/astro-vhub-peering-creator-role.json

    # Assign Custom role to the Astronomer Service Principal ({customer-subscription-id} has to be replaced with your value)
    az role assignment create \
    --assignee a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0 \
    --role "Astro VHub Peering Contributor" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/{customer-subscription-id}"

    # Verify an assignment
    az role assignment list --assignee a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0 --all -o table
    ```

4. Contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/open-support-request) to tell them that you granted them permissions to the Astronomer Service Principal. In addition, provide the following details in your request:

    - Astro Cluster ID 
    - Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID with a VHub
    - Resource group ID
    - VHub name and preferable name for the peering
    - (Optional) Firewall IP address if you use any on the VHub side.

After receiving your request, Astronomer support creates a VHub peering connection to Astro VNet. No other actions are required from you. Astronomer support will notify you when the connection is ready to use.

When the network connection is confirmed, you can delete the temporary roles you created using the following command. Replace `{customer-subscription-id}` with your value:

    ```sh
    az role assignment delete --assignee a67e6057-7138-4f78-bbaf-fd9db7b8aab0 --role "Astro VHub Peering Contributor" --scope "/subscriptions/{customer-subscription-id}"
    ```

<TabItem value="Azure Private Link">

:::info

This connection option is only available for dedicated Astro Hosted clusters and Astro Hybrid.

:::

Use Azure Private Link to create private connections from Astro to your Azure services without exposing your data to the public internet.

Astro clusters are pre-configured with the Azure blob private endpoint.

To request additional endpoints, or assistance connecting to other Azure services, provide [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/open-support-request) with the following information for the resource you want to connect to using Private Link:

- Resource name
- Resource ID
- Private endpoint

For example, to connect with Azure Container Registry:

1. Follow the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal?tabs=azure-cli) to create the [container registry](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry). Copy the name of container registry.
2. Follow the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-private-link#create-a-private-endpoint---new-registry) to create a private endpoint for your container registry. Then, copy the name of the **Data endpoint**.
3. Then, from the left panel, go to **Overview** menu, and click on JSON view in **Essentials**, to copy the resource ID. You can also run Azure CLI command `az acr show -n myRegistry` to get the resource ID.
4. Contact [Astronomer Support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/open-support-request) with your request to connect. Provide the resource name, data endpoint name, and resource ID.
5. When Astronomer support adds an Azure private endpoint, corresponding private DNS zone and Canonical Name (CNAME) records are created to allow you to address the service by its private link name. Astronomer support will send the connection request in Azure Portal's [Private Link Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network/PrivateLinkCenterBlade/~/pendingconnections).
6. Approve the connection requests from your Azure portal, then confirm that you've completed this in your support ticket. Astronomer support will then test whether the DNS resolves the endpoint correctly.

After Astronomer configures the connection, you can create Airflow connections to your resource. In some circumstances, you might need to modify your DAGs to address the service by its private link name (For example, `StorageAccountA.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` instead of `StorageAccountA.blob.core.windows.net`).

Note that you'll incur additional Azure infrastructure costs for every Azure private endpoint that you use. See [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/private-link/).
