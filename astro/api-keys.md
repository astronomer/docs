You can use API keys to programmatically deploy DAGs to a Deployment on Astro.

A Deployment API key has the following properties:

- It can be used to deploy code to Astro via [CI/CD](ci-cd.md).
- Its key ID and secret are valid indefinitely and can be used to access Deployments without manual authentication.
- It is deleted permanently if its corresponding Deployment is deleted.
- It can be used to fetch a short-lived access token that assumes the permissions of the Deployment API key. This access token can be used to make requests to the [Airflow REST API](airflow-api.md).

## Create an API Key

To create an API key for a Deployment:

1. In the Cloud UI, open your Deployment.
2. In the **API Keys** menu, click **Add API Key**:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/add-api-key.png" alt="Add API Key button" />
    </div>

3. Give the key a name and description, then click **Create API Key**:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/create-api-key.png" alt="Create API Key button" />
    </div>

From here, you can copy the API key ID and secret for use in API calls and CI/CD pipelines. Make sure to save the key secret securely, as this is the only time you will have access to see it in plain text.

:::tip

If you just need to make a single API call, you can use a temporary user authentication token instead of a Deployment API key ID and secret pair. To retrieve a temporary authentication token, go to `cloud.astronomer.io/token` and copy the token that appears. This token is valid only for 24 hours.

## Using Deployment API Keys

Deployment API keys are primarily used to automate actions that otherwise require manual inputs. They allow you to:

- Deploy code to Astro [via CI/CD](ci-cd.md) with tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- Deploy code to Astro [via the Astro CLI](deploy-code.md) without user authentication.
- Automate requests to the [Airflow REST API](airflow-api.md).

## Delete an API Key

To delete a Deployment API Key:

1. In the Cloud UI, open your Deployment.
2. In the menu for the API key you want to delete, click **Edit**:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/edit-api-key.png" alt="Edit API Key button" />
    </div>

3. Click **Delete API Key**, then follow the onscreen prompt to finalize the deletion:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/delete-api-key.png" alt="Delete API Key button" />
    </div>
