## Log in to the Cloud IDE

The Cloud IDE is located within the Astro UI and is available to all Astro customers by default.

To access it, log in to the [Astro UI (cloud.astronomer.io)](cloud.astronomer.io) and select a Workspace. Then, click on the **Cloud IDE** tab in the left sidebar. You'll be presented with a list of projects in that Workspace.
