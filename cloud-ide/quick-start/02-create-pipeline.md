Now that you've created your project, you can create your first pipeline. To do so, click on the **Create Pipeline** button in the top right corner of the screen.

Fill in a name and optional description for your pipeline, then click **Create**. Note that the name of your pipeline must be unique within the project, and it must also be a Python identifier (i.e. it must not contain spaces or special characters). The pipeline name specified here will correspond to your Airflow DAG's name.

After clicking **Create**, you'll be taken to the pipeline editor. This is where you'll write your pipeline code.
