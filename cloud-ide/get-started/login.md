The Cloud IDE is located within the Astro UI and is available to all Astro customers by default.

To access it, log in to the [Astro UI (cloud.astronomer.io)](cloud.astronomer.io) and select a Workspace. Then, click on the **Cloud IDE** tab in the left sidebar. You'll be presented with a list of projects in that Workspace.
