A **project** is a collection of pipelines along with execution environment configuration (e.g. connections, variables, and requirements). Projects can get linked to Git repositories to enable CI/CD workflows. Projects are created and managed at the workspace level.

## Find your projects

To access your projects, log in to the [Astro UI (cloud.astronomer.io)](cloud.astronomer.io) and select a workspace. Then, click on the **Cloud IDE** tab in the left sidebar. You'll be presented with a list of projects in that workspace.

## View a project

To view a project, click on its name in the list. You'll be taken to the project's **Overview** page, which contains a list of all DAGs in the project. Here, you'll also find a list of connections, variables, and requirements.
