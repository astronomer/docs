A **pipeline** is a collection of cells (Python, SQL, etc.) that are executed as part of an Airflow DAG. Pipelines are created and managed at the project level.

## Create a pipeline

To create a pipeline, click on the **+ Pipeline** button in the top right corner of the **Pipelines** page. You'll be prompted to enter a name and an optional description for your pipeline. Once you've done so, click **Create**. You'll be taken to the pipeline editor after the pipeline is created.
