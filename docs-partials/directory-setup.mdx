1. Create a new directory for your Astro project:

    ```sh
    mkdir <your-astro-project-name>
    ```

2. Open the directory:

    ```sh
    cd <your-astro-project-name>
    ```

3. Run the following Astro CLI command to initialize an Astro project in the directory:

    ```sh
    astro dev init
    ```

    This command generates a set of files that will build into a Docker image that you can both run on your local machine and deploy to Astro.

4.  Add the following line to your Astro project `requirements.txt` file:

    ```sh
    astronomer-starship
    ```

    When you deploy your code, this line installs the Starship migration tool on your Deployment so that you can migrate Airflow resources from your soure environment to Astro.

5. (Optional) Run the following command to initialize a new git repository for your Astro project:

    ```sh
    git init
    ```
