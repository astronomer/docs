Astro Runtime is a production ready, data orchestration tool based on Apache Airflow that is distributed as a Docker image and is required by all Astronomer products. It is intended to provide organizations with improved functionality, reliability, efficiency, and performance. Deploying Astro Runtime is a requirement if your organization is using Astro.

Astronomer maintenance and lifecycle policies are part of the distribution and define the period that specific Astro Runtime versions are supported and how frequently updates are provided.

## Release channels

To meet the unique needs of different operating environments, Astro Runtime versions are associated with the following release channels:

- **Stable:** Includes the latest Astronomer and Apache Airflow features, available on release
- **Long-term Support (LTS):** Includes additional testing, stability, and maintenance for a core set of features

All major Astro Runtime versions belong to the Astro Runtime stable release channel. The LTS release channel is a subset of the stable release channel and includes additional stability, reliability, and support. For more information on how Astro Runtime is versioned, see [Runtime versioning](runtime-image-architecture.mdx#runtime-versioning).

For users that want to keep up with the latest Astronomer and Airflow features on an incremental basis, we recommend upgrading to new versions of Astro Runtime as soon as they are made generally available. This should be regardless of release channel. New versions of Runtime are issued regularly and include timely support for the latest major, minor, and patch versions of Airflow.

For customers looking for less frequent upgrades and functional changes, we recommend following the LTS release channel exclusively.

## Astro Runtime maintenance policy

The maintenance period for an Astro Runtime version depends on its release channel:

| Release Channel | Maintenance Duration                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stable          | 6 months or 3 months after the next major Astro Runtime release, whichever is longer |
| LTS             | 18 months or 6 months after the next LTS Astro Runtime release, whichever is longer  |
