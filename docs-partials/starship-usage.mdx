You might have defined Airflow connections and variables in the following places on your source Airflow environment:

- The Airflow UI (stored in the Airflow metadata database).
- Environment variables
- A secrets backend.

If you defined your Airflow variables and connections in the Airflow UI, you can migrate those to Astro with [Starship](https://astronomer.github.io/starship/). You can check which resources will be migrated by going to **Admin** > **Variables** and **Admin** > **Connections** in the Airflow UI to find your source Airflow environment information.

:::warning

Some environment variables or Airflow Settings, like global environment variable values, can't be migrated to Astro. See [Global environment variables](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/platform-variables) for a list of variables that you can't migrate to Astro.

1. Log in to Astro. In the Astro UI, open the Deployment you're migrating to.
2. Click **Open Airflow** to open the Airflow UI for the Deployment. Copy the URL for the home page. It should look similar to `https://<your-organization>.astronomer.run/<id>/home`.
3. Create a Deployment API token for the Deployment. The token should minimally have permissions to update the Deployment and deploy code. Copy this token. See [Create and manage Deployment API tokens](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/deployment-api-tokens) for additional setup steps.
4. Open the Airflow UI for your source Airflow environment, then go to **Astronomer** > **Migration Tool ðŸš€**.

5. Ensure that the **Astronomer Product** toggle is set to **Astro**.
6. In the **Airflow URL** section, fill in the fields so that the complete URL on the page matches the URL of the Airflow UI for the Deployment you're migrating to. 
7. Specify your API token in the **Token** field. Starship will confirm that it has access to your Deployment. 
8. Click **Connections**. In the table that appears, click **Migrate** for each connection that you want to migrate to Astro. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated âœ…** appears.
8. Click **Pools**. In the table that appears, click **Migrate** for each connection that you want to migrate to Astro. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated âœ…** appears.
9. Click **Variables**. In the table that appears, click **Migrate** for each variable that you want to migrate to Astro. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated âœ…** appears.
10. Click **Variables**. In the table that appears, click **Migrate** for each variable that you want to migrate to Astro. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated âœ…** appears.
11. Click **Environment variables**. In the table that appears, check the box for each environment variable that you want to migrate to Astro, then click **Migrate**. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated âœ…** appears.
11. Click **DAG History**. In the table that appears, check the box for each environment variable that you want to migrate to Astro, then click **Migrate**. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated âœ…** appears.

Refer to the [Configuration](https://astronomer.github.io/starship/operator/#usage) detailed instructions on using the operator.

1. Log in to Astro. In the Astro UI, open the Deployment you're migrating to.
2. Click **Open Airflow** to open the Airflow UI for the Deployment. Copy the URL for the home page. It should look similar to `https://<your-organization>.astronomer.run/<id>/home`.
3. Create a Deployment API token for the Deployment. The token should minimally have permissions to update the Deployment and deploy code. Copy this token. See [Create and manage Deployment API tokens](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/deployment-api-tokens) for additional setup steps.
4. Add the following DAG to your source Airflow environment:

    ```python
    from airflow.models.dag import DAG
    from astronomer.starship.operators import AstroMigrationOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    with DAG(
      dag_id="astronomer_migration_dag",
      start_date=datetime(1970, 1, 1),
      schedule_interval=None,
    ) as dag:
      AstroMigrationOperator(
          task_id='export_meta',
          deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
          token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
      )
    ```
5. Deploy this DAG to your source Airflow environment.
6. Once the DAG is available in the Airflow UI, click **Trigger DAG**, then click **Trigger DAG w/ config**. 
7. In **Configuration JSON**, add the following configuration:

    ```json
    {
        "deployment_url": "<your-deployment-url>",
        "astro_token": "<your-astro-token>"
    }
    ```

8. Replace the following placeholder values:

    - `<your-deployment-url>`: The Deployment URL you copied in Step 2.
    - `<your-astro-token>`: The token you copied in Step 3.

9. Click **Trigger**. After the DAG successfully runs, all connections, variables, and environment variables that are available from the Airflow UI are migrated to Astronomer.
