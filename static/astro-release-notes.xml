This is an additional option to <code>astro deploy</code> that makes for a faster development experience and gives you more flexibility in how you configure CI/CD processes.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="astro/cli/release-notes#deploy-only-dags-with-astro-deploy--dags">Astro CLI 1.7</a> or <a href="deploy-code.md#deploy-dags-only">Deploy DAGs only</a>. For example CI/CD workflows with this feature enabled, see <a href="ci-cd.md">CI/CD</a>.</p><h3>Improved data lineage interface</h3><p>The <strong>Lineage</strong> tab has new features and is better integrated into the Cloud UI.</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/lineage-integrated.png" alt="Updated lineage page"></p><p>Specifically, the tab includes the following improvements:</p><ul>
<li>The process for comparing runs uses a simpler interface and provides more information about the runs you're comparing. See <a href="data-lineage.md#compare-lineage-graphs-from-previous-runs">Compare lineage graphs from previous runs</a>.</li>
<li>Names for UI elements have been updated to more clearly represent Airflow resources. For example, <strong>jobs</strong> is now <strong>runs</strong>, and the <strong>Explore</strong> tab is now <strong>Runs</strong>.</li>
<li>Lineage graphs include new colors and animations to show the flow of data as it moves between runs and datasets.</li>
</ul><h3>Transfer a Deployment</h3><p>You can now transfer a Deployment from one Workspace to another in your Organization. This feature is helpful if you need to change the group of users that have access to a Deployment, or if you create a Deployment in the wrong Workspace.</p><p>See <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#transfer-a-deployment-to-another-workspace">Transfer a Deployment to another Workspace</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>The Kubernetes API is no longer exposed to the public internet on AWS data planes. The allowlist is limited to control plane IPs. New clusters will be created with this configuration, while all existing clusters will be updated by end of next week.</li>

Now you can develop an entire Airflow project, including DAGs, dependencies, and connections entirely within the Cloud UI.</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/ide-overview.png" alt="Example page in the Astro Cloud IDE"></p><p>The Astro Cloud IDE was created with the following objectives:</p><ul>
<li>Configuring Airflow shouldn't be a barrier to running Airflow.</li>
<li>Passing data between tasks should be seamless regardless of what language is used to write the task.</li>
<li>Data pipelines should be quick to deploy and easy to test with CI/CD.</li>
</ul><p>Most importantly, the Astro Cloud IDE was developed to make it easier for new Airflow users to get started and to provide experienced users with a robust development environment.</p><p>To create your first project in the Astro Cloud IDE, see the <a href="cloud-ide/quickstart.md">Cloud IDE quickstart</a>. To deploy your project to Astro, see <a href="cloud-ide/deploy-project.md">Deploy your Cloud IDE project to Astro</a>.</p><p>:::info</p><p>&lt;!-- id to make it easier to remove: cloud-ide-preview-banner --&gt;</p><p>The Cloud IDE is currently in <a href="feature-previews.md">Public Preview</a>.

Metrics include task successes, DAG processing time, frequency of import errors, and more.</p><p>For organizations already using the observability service, this integration allows your team to standardize on tooling and gain a more granular view of Deployment metrics in a single place. Once the integration is configured, Astro automatically exports all available metrics to Datadog. For a complete list of supported metrics, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/airflow/?tab=host#data-collected">Data Collected</a>.</p><p>To learn more, see <a href="deployment-metrics.md#export-airflow-metrics-to-datadog">Export Airflow metrics to Datadog</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>The Cloud UI now automatically ensures that worker queue names are valid as you type in real time.</li>
<li>The number of times that a user can enter the wrong credentials for Astro before being locked out has been reduced from 10 to 6.</li>
<li>You can now configure <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues">worker queues</a> to have a minimum <strong>Worker count</strong> of 0 workers.

</ul>]]></description></item><item><title>August 18, 2022</title><link>https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/release-notes#august-18-2022</link><description><![CDATA[<h3>Create multiple worker queues</h3><p>Worker queues are a new way to configure your Deployment to best fit the needs of your tasks. A worker queue is a set of configurations that apply to a group of workers in your Deployment. Within a worker queue, you can configure worker type and size as well as autoscaling behavior. By configuring multiple worker queues for different types of tasks, you can better optimize for the performance, reliability, and throughput of your Deployment.</p><p>In the Cloud UI, you can now create multiple worker queues. Once you create a worker queue, you can assign a task to that worker queue by adding a simple <code>queue='&lt;worker-queue-name&gt;'</code> argument in your DAG code.</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/worker-queues.png" alt="Worker queue configurations in the Cloud UI"></p><p>This feature enables the ability to:</p><ul>
<li>Use more than one worker type within a single Deployment and cluster. Previously, a single cluster on Astro supported only one worker type.</li>
<li>Isolate long-running tasks from short-running tasks to avoid errors related to competing resource requests.</li>
<li>Fine-tune autoscaling behavior for different groups of tasks within a single Deployment.</li>
</ul><p>For example, if you have a task that requires significantly more CPU than memory, you can assign it to a queue that's configured with workers that are optimized for compute usage.</p><p>To learn more about configuring worker queues, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues">Configure Deployment resources</a>.</p><h3>New worker sizing</h3><p>This Astro release introduces a new, simple way to allocate resources to the workers in your Deployment. Instead of choosing a varying combination of CPU and memory, you can now select a worker type in the Cloud UI as long as it's enabled in your cluster. For example, <code>m5.2xlarge</code> or <code>c6i.8xlarge</code> on AWS. Once you select a worker type, Astronomer will create the biggest worker that that worker type can support to ensure that your tasks have enough resources to execute successfully.</p><p>Astro's worker sizing enables a few benefits:</p><ul>
<li>You can no longer configure a worker that is too large or otherwise not supported by your underlying cluster. Previously, misconfiguring worker size often resulted in task failures.</li>
<li>A more efficient use of infrastructure. Astronomer has found that a lower number of larger workers is more efficient than a higher number of smaller workers.</li>
<li>A higher level of reliability. This worker sizing model results in less volatility and a lower frequency of cluster autoscaling events, which lowers the frequency of errors such as zombie tasks and missing task logs.</li>
<li>The legacy <strong>AU</strong> unit is no longer applicable in the context of the worker. You only have to think about CPU, memory, and worker type.</li>
</ul><p>Worker sizing on Astro is now defined in the context of worker queues. For more information about worker sizing, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues">Configure Deployment resources</a>. For a list of supported worker types, see the <a href="resource-reference-aws.md#worker-node-types">AWS</a>, <a href="resource-reference-gcp.md#worker-node-types">GCP</a>, and <a href="resource-reference-azure.md#worker-node-types">Azure</a> resource references.</p><h3>New Maximum Tasks per Worker setting</h3><p>A new <strong>Maximum Tasks per Worker</strong> configuration is now available in the Deployment view of the Cloud UI. Maximum tasks per worker determines the maximum number of tasks that a single worker can process at a time and is the basis of worker autoscaling behavior. It is equivalent to <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#worker-concurrency">worker concurrency</a> in Apache Airflow.</p><p>Previously, maximum tasks per worker was permanently set to 16 and was not configurable on Astro. Now, you can set maximum tasks per worker anywhere between 1 and 64 based on the needs of your tasks. It can be set per worker queue on a Deployment.</p><p>To learn more, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-autoscaling-logic">Worker autoscaling logic</a>.</p><h3>New Worker Count (Min-Max) setting</h3><p>A new <strong>Worker Count (Min-Max)</strong> configuration is now available in the Deployment view of the Cloud UI. This value defines the minimum and maximum number of workers that can run at a time.</p><p>Use this setting to fine-tune worker autoscaling behavior in your Deployment. By default, the minimum number of workers is 1 and the maximum is 10.</p><p>To learn more, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queue-settings">Worker queue settings</a>.</p><h3>Support for multiple Organizations</h3><p>A single user account can now belong to multiple Organizations. A user with multiple Organizations can switch to another Organization by clicking on their current Organization's name in the Cloud UI and then clicking <strong>Switch Organization</strong>.</p><p>Note that switching Organizations with the Astro CLI is not yet supported. For more information, see <a href="log-in-to-astro.md#switch-organizations">Switch Organizations</a>.</p><h3>New Azure region (Australia East)</h3><p>You can now <a href="create-cluster.md">create an Astro cluster on Azure</a> in Australia East (New South Wales).</p><p>For a list of all Azure regions that Astro supports, see <a href="resource-reference-azure.md#supported-regions">Azure resource reference</a>.</p><h3>New Google Cloud Platform regions</h3><p>You can now <a href="create-cluster.md">create an Astro cluster on GCP</a> in the following regions:</p><ul>

<li>Organization Billing Admins can now view <a href="deployment-metrics.md#astro-usage">usage</a> for all Workspaces in their Organization regardless of their Workspace permissions.</li>
<li>Workspace Editors can now delete any Deployment in their Workspace.</li>
</ul><h3>Automatic access for new users authenticating with an identity provider</h3><p>If your organization has <a href="configure-idp.md">implemented an identity provider (IdP)</a>, any new user who authenticates to Astro through your IdP is now automatically assigned the Organization Member role. This means that users authenticating through your IdP do not need to be invited by email before joining your Organization.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Added a security measure that ensures Workspace roles can only be assigned to users who have an Organization role in the Organization in which the Workspace is hosted. This ensures that a user who does not belong to your Organization cannot be assigned a Workspace role within it.</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a>, a microservice that increases resilience by pooling database connections, is now considered highly available on Astro. Every Deployment must now have 2 PgBouncer Pods instead of 1, each assigned to a different node within the cluster. This change protects against pod-level connection issues resulting in <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html#zombie-undead-tasks">zombie tasks</a>, which was previously seen during cluster downscaling events. PgBouncer is fully managed by Astronomer and is not configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Airflow scheduler is now configured with an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity">anti-affinity policy</a> to limit the possibility of all schedulers for a single Deployment being impacted by an incident within a single node on an Astro cluster. For users who set <strong>Scheduler Count</strong> in the Cloud UI to 2, this means that those 2 scheduler Pods cannot be assigned to the same node and instead require a minimum of 2 nodes total. To avoid significant increases in cost, 3 or 4 schedulers can share the same 2 nodes and will not necessarily result in a higher node count minimum.</p>
</li>

The first step in enabling these features is to implement lineage backends for existing Astro customers.</p><p>Starting on March 31st and continuing over the next couple of weeks, all Astro Deployments on Runtime 4.2.0+ will be upgraded to emit lineage events. As a result of this change, you might start seeing lineage-related scheduler logs such as the following:</p><pre><code class="language-text">[2022-03-30, 12:17:39 UTC] {great_expectations_extractor.py:17} INFO - Did not find great_expectations_provider library or failed to import it
[2022-03-24, 23:40:01 UTC] {client.py:74} INFO - Constructing openlineage client to send events to https://api.astro-astronomer.datakin.com
</code></pre><p>A few additional notes about this upgrade:</p><ul>
<li>You can ignore any lineage logs that indicate an error or failed process, such as the first line in the example logs above. These logs will more accurately reflect the state of your lineage functionality once lineage features are launched on Astro.</li>
<li>Deployments on Runtime 4.2.0+ will be updated to emit data lineage events only after you <a href="deploy-code.md">push code</a>. Until you do so, this change will not be applied.</li>
<li>Because Astronomer is upgrading each customer individually over time, the exact date that you will start seeing these logs will vary.</li>
<li>When you push code to a Deployment on Runtime 4.2.0+ and trigger this update, all other Deployments on Runtime 4.2.0+ in the same Workspace will also restart in order to receive the lineage backend update. If you plan to push code to any Deployment affected by this change, then we recommend doing so at a time where you can tolerate some Airflow components restarting. For more information about expected behavior, see <a href="deploy-code.md#what-happens-during-a-code-deploy">What Happens During a Code Deploy</a>.</li>

On Astro, maximum node count represents the total number of EC2 nodes that your cluster can support at any given time. For an Astro cluster on AWS, EC2 nodes are the primary unit of infrastructure required to run a Deployment and its components, including workers and the Airflow scheduler. New clusters have a maximum node count of 20 by default, but the setting can be modified to any value from 2 to 100 at any time.</p><p>Previously, maximum node count was a fixed, global setting that applied to all customers on Astro and could not be configured per cluster. Now, your organization can modify this setting as your workloads evolve and more Deployments are created. Once the limit is reached, your cluster will not be able to auto-scale and worker pods may fail to schedule.</p><p>To update this setting for an existing cluster, reach out to <a href="https://cloud.astronomer.io/support">Astronomer support</a> and provide the name of your cluster and the desired maximum node count.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>

By setting up a third-party identity provider, a user in your organization will be automatically logged in to Astro if they're already logged in via your IdP. By adding new Astro users through your IdP's own user management system, Workspace admins can automatically add new users to their Workspace without those users needing to individually sign up for Astro.</p><p>For more information about this feature read <a href="configure-idp.md">Set up an identity provider</a>.</p><h3>Support for the Astro CLI</h3><p>The Astro CLI (<code>astro</code>) is now generally available as the official command-line tool for Astro. It is a direct replacement of the previously released <code>astro</code> executable and comes with various significant improvements. We encourage all customers to upgrade.</p><p>For more information on the Astro CLI, see <a href="cli/release-notes.md">CLI Release Notes</a>. For install instructions, read <a href="cli/install-cli.md">Install the CLI</a>.</p><h3>Multiple authentication methods for a single user account</h3><p>Astro now supports multiple authentication methods for a single user account. This means that as long as you're using a consistent email address, you now have the flexibility to authenticate with GitHub, Google, username/password, and/or <a href="configure-idp.md">an external identity provider (idP)</a> at any time. Previously, a single user account could only be associated with one authentication method, which could not be changed after the account was created.</p><p>This also means that all Organizations now have GitHub, Google, and username/password authentication methods enabled by default for all users.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Changed the default RDS instance type for new clusters from <code>db.r5.xlarge</code> to <code>db.r5.large</code>, which represents a monthly cost reduction of ~50% for newly provisioned clusters. Customers with existing clusters will need to request a downscale via <a href="https://cloud.astronomer.io/support">Astronomer support</a></li>

When you first log in via the Cloud UI, you now only need to enter the email address for your account. Astro assumes your Organization and brings you directly to your Astro Organization's login screen.</p><p>This change serves as a foundation for future SSO and authentication features. In upcoming releases, users will be able to authenticate via custom identity providers like Okta and Azure Active Directory.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Significant improvements to the load times of various Cloud UI pages and elements.</li>
<li>In the Cloud UI, the tooltips in the <strong>Resource Settings</strong> section of a Deployment's page now show the definition of 1 AU. This should make it easier to translate AU to CPU and Memory.</li>
<li>Scheduler logs in the Cloud UI no longer show <code>DEBUG</code>-level logs.</li>
<li>To ensure that all workers have enough resources to run basic workloads, you can no longer allocate less than 10 AU to <strong>Worker Resources</strong>.</li>
</ul>]]></description></item><item><title>January 6, 2022</title><link>https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/release-notes#january-6-2022</link><description><![CDATA[<h3>Improvements to "Scheduler Logs" in the Cloud UI</h3><p>The <strong>Scheduler Logs</strong> tab in the Cloud UI has been updated to make logs easier to read, separate, and parse. Specifically:</p><ul>
<li>You can now filter logs by type (<code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARN</code>, and <code>ERROR</code>).</li>
<li>The page now shows logs for the past 24 hours instead of the past 30 minutes.</li>
<li>The page now shows a maximum of 500 logs instead of a lower maximum.</li>
<li>When looking at a Deployment's logs, you can return to the Deployment's information using the <strong>Deployment Details</strong> button.</li>
</ul><p><img src="/img/release-notes/log-improvements.png" alt="Logs page in the UI"></p><h3>Removal of worker termination grace period</h3><p>The <strong>Worker Termination Grace Period</strong> setting is no longer available in the Cloud UI or API. Previously, users could set this to anywhere between 1 minute and 24 hours per Deployment. This was to prevent running tasks from being interrupted by a code push. Today, however, existing Celery workers don't have to terminate in order for new workers to spin up and start executing tasks. Instead, existing workers will continue to execute running tasks while a new set of workers gets spun up concurrently to start executing the most recent code.</p><p>To simplify Deployment configuration and reflect current functionality:</p><ul>
<li>The worker Termination Grace Period was removed from the Cloud UI</li>
<li>This value was permanently set to 24 hours for all Deployments on Astro</li>
</ul><p>This does not change or affect execution behavior for new or existing Deployments. For more information, read <a href="deploy-code.md#what-happens-during-a-code-deploy">What Happens During a Code Deploy</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Removed <em>Kubernetes Version</em> column from the <strong>Clusters</strong> table. This value was previously inaccurate and is not needed. The Kubernetes version of any particular Astro cluster is set and modified exclusively by Astro as part of our managed service.</li>

</ul><p>For a full list of AWS regions supported on Astro, see <a href="https://docs.astronomer.io/resource-reference-aws.md#aws-region">Resources required for Astro on AWS</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>You can now see your Deployment's <strong>Namespace</strong> in the <strong>Deployments</strong> menu and on the Deployment information screen in the Cloud UI. Namespace is a required argument to run tasks with the KubernetesPodOperator. It is also required to submit an issue to <a href="https://cloud.astronomer.io/support">Astronomer support</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/docs/namespace.png" alt="Deployment namespace available on a Deployment's information page"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cloud UI now shows a warning if you attempt to exit Environment Variable configuration without saving your changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Deployment's health status is now based on the health of both the Airflow webserver and scheduler. Previously, a Deployment's health status was only based on the health of the webserver. Now, the Cloud UI will show that your Deployment is "Healthy" only if both components are running as expected.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>The Cloud UI now has error handling for attempts to access a Deployment that does not exist.</li>
<li>If you attempt to modify an existing secret environment variable, the <strong>Value</strong> field is now blank instead of showing hidden characters.</li>
</ul><h3>Data plane improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Amazon EBS volumes have been upgraded from gp2 to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-new-amazon-ebs-general-purpose-volumes-gp3/">gp3</a> for improved scale and performance.</li>
<li>EBS volumes and S3 buckets are now encrypted by default.</li>
<li>The ability to enable public access to any Amazon S3 bucket on an Astro data plane is now blocked per a new AWS account policy. Previously, public access was disabled by default but could be overridden by a user creating a new S3 bucket with public access enabled. This AWS account policy could be overridden by AWS account owners, but Astronomer strongly recommends against doing so.</li>

From here, you can now see all Workspaces that you have access to, as well as information and settings related to your <strong>Organization</strong>: a collection of specific users, teams, and Workspaces. Many features related to Organizations are coming soon, but the UI now better represents how Organizations are structured and what you can do with them in the future:</p><p><img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note1.png" alt="New global menu in the UI"></p><p>You can now also select specific Workspaces to work in. When you click in to a Workspace, you'll notice the left menu bar is now entirely dedicated to Workspace actions:</p><ul>
<li>The Rocket icon brings you to the <strong>Deployments</strong> menu.</li>
<li>The People icon brings you to the <strong>Workspace Access</strong> menu.</li>
<li>The Gear icon brings you to the <strong>Workspace Settings</strong> menu.</li>
</ul><p>To return to the global menu, you can either click the Astro "A" or click the Workspace name to produce a dropdown menu with your Organization.</p><p><img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note2.png" alt="New Workspace menu in the UI"></p><p>All user configurations can be found by clicking your user profile picture in the upper right corner of the UI. From the dropdown menu that appears, you can both configure user settings and access other Astronomer resources such as documentation and the Astronomer Registry.</p><p><img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note3.png" alt="New profile menu in the UI"></p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>You can now create new clusters in <code>us-east-2</code> and <code>ca-central-1</code>.</li>
<li>In the Deployment detail page, <strong>Astro Runtime</strong> now shows the version of Apache Airflow that the Deployment's Astro Runtime version is based on.</li>
<li>You can now create or modify an existing Astro cluster to run any size of the <code>t2</code>,<code>t3</code>, <code>m5</code>, or <code>m5d</code> <a href="resource-reference-aws.md">AWS EC2 instances</a>.</li>
