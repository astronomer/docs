On Astro Hosted, Airflow environments are managed and hosted entirely by Astronomer, enabling you to shift your focus from infrastructure to data.</p><p>For more information about how Astro Hosted works, see the <a href="https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/astro-architecture">Architecture overview</a>.</p><p>If you're already an Astro user and your Deployments run in your company's own cloud, you're using <em>Astro Hybrid</em>. This version of Astro was formerly known as Astro - Bring Your Own Cloud.</p><p>To see whether you're an Astro Hybrid user, open your Organization in the Cloud UI and go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong>. Your version of Astro is listed under <strong>Product Type</strong>.</p><p>See <a href="#documentation-refactor-for-astro-hybrid">Documentation refactor for Astro Hybrid</a> to learn how the documentation has changed for current Astro Hybrid users.</p><h3>Documentation refactor for Astro Hybrid</h3><p>The following updates have been made to documentation to accommodate new Astro Hosted information:</p><ul>
<li>Astro Hybrid documentation now has a dedicated menu under "Administration" that contains all docs related to Hybrid installation and cluster management. See <a href="https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/hybrid-overview">Astro Hybrid overview</a>.</li>
<li>All other docs now assume Astro Hosted by default. If a feature is functionally different between Hosted and Hybrid, the documentation for that feature will include a note about how that setup differs for Hybrid. Look for the blue <strong>Alternative Astro Hybrid setup</strong> notes throughout documentation.</li>

Using the Kubernetes executor, you can:</p><ul>
<li>Ensure that tasks running longer than 24 hours are not interrupted when your team deploys code.</li>
<li>Run tasks with different version dependencies in the same Astro project.</li>
<li>Request specific amounts of CPU and memory for individual tasks.</li>
<li>Automatically down your resources when no tasks are running.</li>
</ul><p>The Kubernetes executor runs each task in its own Kubernetes Pod instead of in shared Celery workers. Astronomer fully manages the infrastructure required to run the executor and automatically spins Pods up and down for each of your task runs. This executor is a good fit for teams that want fine-grained control over the execution environment for each of their tasks.</p><p>To learn whether the Kubernetes executor works for your use case, see <a href="executors.md#choose-an-executor">Choose an executor</a>. To configure the Kubernetes executor for a task or Deployment, see <a href="executors.md#configure-the-kubernetes-executor">Configure the Kubernetes executor</a>.</p><h3>Simplified Organization management in the Cloud UI</h3><p>The Cloud UI has been redesigned so that Organization settings tabs are now available in the left menu. Use this new menu to switch between pages as you can for Workspace settings.</p><p>While most tabs were migrated directly to the left menu with the same name, some pages have been renamed and moved:</p><ul>
<li>Formerly located in <strong>Overview</strong>, your Workspace list is now available in <strong>Workspaces</strong>.</li>
<li>Formerly located in the <strong>People</strong> tab, Organization user management settings are now in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Access Management</strong>.</li>
<li>Formerly located in the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, general Organization settings are now in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong>.</li>
</ul><h3>New Astro Cloud IDE integration with GitLab</h3><p>You can now configure a GitLab repository in your Astro Cloud IDE project. Configuring a GitLab repository allows you to commit your pipelines and deploy them to Astro directly from the Astro Cloud IDE. See <a href="cloud-ide/deploy-project.md#deploy-a-project-from-a-git-repository-to-astro">Deploy a project from a Git repository to Astro</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Clusters on an Astro - Hosted installation no longer retain Airflow logs which are older than 90 days.</li>

Instead, Astro now assumes a cross-account IAM role with the minimum necessary permissions for running and managing clusters. See <a href="install-aws-hybrid.md">Install Astro on AWS</a> for more information.</p><h3>IdP-initiated logins through the Okta dashboard</h3><p>If your Organization uses Okta as your Astro identity provider, you can now log in to Astro directly from your <a href="https://help.okta.com/eu/en-us/Content/Topics/end-user/dashboard-overview.htm">Okta Apps dashboard</a>. If you've been authenticated by Okta, you no longer need to be authenticated by Astro when you access it through your dashboard.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Ingress to the Kubernetes API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure clusters is now limited to Astro control plane IPs. This change will be implemented on all clusters in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>To protect the functionality of Astro monitoring services, you can no longer override the values of the following environment variables:</p>
<ul>

Users now authenticate to the Astro platform instead of individual Organizations, and Organizations can set permissions for how users can modify and access resources. This model prioritizes identity verification and enforces authentication policies for user email domains.</p><p>For all users logging in to Astro, this migration has the following effects:</p><ul>
<li>Instead of being redirected to separate login pages for each Organization, all Astro users log in through a universal login page.</li>
<li>Users belonging to multiple Organizations no longer have to log in again when switching Organizations.</li>
<li>Users no longer need to enter their email on a separate page before they log in to the Cloud UI.</li>
<li>If your Organization enforces single sign-on (SSO), users can now authenticate to Astro with a username and password when your email domain doesn't enforce SSO.</li>
</ul><p>For Organization Owners, this migration has the following additional effects:</p><ul>
<li>You can now use an SSO bypass link to log in to Astro if your SSO connection is disrupted.</li>
<li>Your Organization now has a list of owned email domains, and any users logging into Astro with one of those domains will be redirected to your configured identity provider.</li>
</ul><p>For more information about how these changes can affect the Astro log in experience, see the <a href="log-in-to-astro.md#frequently-asked-questions">Login FAQ</a>. To configure authentication behavior, see <a href="configure-idp.md#advanced-setup">Configure SSO</a>.</p><h3>New Hosted regions available</h3><p>You can now create clusters in the following regions on an Astro - Hosted installation.</p><ul>

<li><strong>SQL</strong>: Run a SQL query against an existing database connection and save the query results in an XCom file for use by other cells. Use this cell type to run smaller queries and store the results in Airflow for quick access by other cells.</li>
<li><strong>Warehouse SQL</strong>: Run a SQL query against an existing database connection and store the query results in your data warehouse. Use this cell type for data operations that require more storage and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong>: Add inline Markdown comments to your generated DAG code. Use this cell type to document code decisions and to make it easier for team members to collaborate on shared pipelines.</li>
</ul><p>For more information about a specific cell type, see <a href="cloud-ide/run-sql.md">Run SQL in the Astro Cloud IDE</a>, <a href="cloud-ide/run-python.md">Run Python in the Cloud IDE</a>, and <a href="cloud-ide/document-pipeline.md">Add documentation to an Astro Cloud IDE pipeline</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>To reduce the time it takes for Airflow to parse new DAG files, the default value for <code>AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__DAG_DIR_LIST_INTERVAL</code> has been reduced from 5 minutes to 30 seconds for all Deployments regardless of Runtime version. For most users, this means that you will see new DAGs appear in the Airflow UI faster.</li>
<li>In the Cloud UI, a banner now appears if there is an incident reported on the <a href="https://status.astronomer.io/">Astro status page</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>Sorting the <strong>Organization Role</strong> column in the <strong>People</strong> tab of the Cloud UI now works as expected.</li>

<li>There is a new <strong>Commit</strong> button in the Cloud UI that is separate from the <strong>Configuring GitHub</strong> menu.</li>
<li>The default CI/CD pipeline included in the Cloud IDE project supports DAG-only deploys. Deploying DAG changes to Astro using the CI/CD pipeline is now significantly faster.</li>
<li>The <strong>Configure GitHub</strong> menu in the Cloud UI now includes a <strong>Clone Repo</strong> settings menu. Enabling this option makes other files in your GitHub repository, such as helper functions in the <code>include</code> folder of your project, accessible when you run DAGs in the Cloud IDE.</li>
<li>You can now explicitly mark upstream dependencies for a task cell from the cell's configuration menu.</li>
</ul><p>For more information about configuring GitHub and deploying code with the Cloud IDE, see <a href="cloud-ide/deploy-project.md">Deploy a project from the Cloud IDE to Astro</a>.</p><h3>Support for n2 worker types on GCP</h3><p>You can now configure worker queues with the following <code>n2</code> worker types on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) clusters:</p><ul>
<li><code>n2-standard-4</code></li>
<li><code>n2-standard-8</code></li>
<li><code>n2-standard-16</code></li>
<li><code>n2-highmem-4</code></li>
<li><code>n2-highmem-8</code></li>
<li><code>n2-highmem-16</code></li>
<li><code>n2-highcpu-4</code></li>
<li><code>n2-highcpu-8</code></li>
<li><code>n2-highcpu-16</code></li>
</ul><p>For more information about these worker types, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#n2_machines">N2 machine series</a>. For a list of all worker types available on GCP, see <a href="resource-reference-gcp-hybrid.md#worker-node-size-resource-reference">Worker node size resource reference</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>In the <strong>Clusters</strong> tab of the Cloud UI, you can now click a cluster entry to see details about the cluster configuration, including which <strong>Worker Types</strong> are enabled for the cluster.</li>
<li>The Deployment details page in the Cloud UI now includes an <strong>ID</strong> pane. A Deployment ID is required when you deploy code using a CI/CD process.</li>
<li>The <strong>OpenLineage URL</strong> for your Organization is now available on the <strong>Settings</strong> page in the Cloud UI. An OpenLineage URL is required to <a href="set-up-data-lineage.md">integrate data lineage from some external systems</a>.</li>
<li>Workspaces are now sorted alphabetically in the Cloud UI.</li>
<li>In Astro CLI version 1.8.0 or later, running <code>astro deploy</code> with an empty or missing <code>dags</code> folder does not erase or override existing DAGs. Instead, the directory is excluded from the build and push process to Astro. This lets you manage your DAGs and project files in separate repositories when using <a href="deploy-code.md#deploy-dags-only">DAG-only deploys</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Astro temporarily stored DAGs for DAG-only deploys in a new directory named <code>/usr/local/airflow/dags/current</code>, which could cause import errors in user code.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where task runs triggered in the Cloud IDE did not have access to project environment variables.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Deployment metrics for memory usage were not always accurate.</li>

<li>Names for UI elements have been updated to more clearly represent Airflow resources. For example, <strong>jobs</strong> is now <strong>runs</strong>, and the <strong>Explore</strong> tab is now <strong>Runs</strong>.</li>
<li>Lineage graphs include new colors and animations to show the flow of data as it moves between runs and datasets.</li>
</ul><h3>Transfer a Deployment</h3><p>You can now transfer a Deployment from one Workspace to another in your Organization. This feature is helpful if you need to change the group of users that have access to a Deployment, or if you create a Deployment in the wrong Workspace.</p><p>See <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#transfer-a-deployment-to-another-workspace">Transfer a Deployment to another Workspace</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>The Kubernetes API is no longer exposed to the public internet on AWS data planes. The allowlist is limited to control plane IPs. New clusters will be created with this configuration, while all existing clusters will be updated by end of next week.</li>

By configuring multiple worker queues for different types of tasks, you can better optimize for the performance, reliability, and throughput of your Deployment.</p><p>In the Cloud UI, you can now create multiple worker queues. Once you create a worker queue, you can assign a task to that worker queue by adding a simple <code>queue='&lt;worker-queue-name&gt;'</code> argument in your DAG code.</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/worker-queues.png" alt="Worker queue configurations in the Cloud UI"></p><p>This feature enables the ability to:</p><ul>
<li>Use more than one worker type within a single Deployment and cluster. Previously, a single cluster on Astro supported only one worker type.</li>
<li>Isolate long-running tasks from short-running tasks to avoid errors related to competing resource requests.</li>
<li>Fine-tune autoscaling behavior for different groups of tasks within a single Deployment.</li>
</ul><p>For example, if you have a task that requires significantly more CPU than memory, you can assign it to a queue that's configured with workers that are optimized for compute usage.</p><p>To learn more about configuring worker queues, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues">Configure Deployment resources</a>.</p><h3>New worker sizing</h3><p>This Astro release introduces a new, simple way to allocate resources to the workers in your Deployment. Instead of choosing a varying combination of CPU and memory, you can now select a worker type in the Cloud UI as long as it's enabled in your cluster. For example, <code>m5.2xlarge</code> or <code>c6i.8xlarge</code> on AWS. Once you select a worker type, Astronomer will create the biggest worker that that worker type can support to ensure that your tasks have enough resources to execute successfully.</p><p>Astro's worker sizing enables a few benefits:</p><ul>
<li>You can no longer configure a worker that is too large or otherwise not supported by your underlying cluster. Previously, misconfiguring worker size often resulted in task failures.</li>
<li>A more efficient use of infrastructure. Astronomer has found that a lower number of larger workers is more efficient than a higher number of smaller workers.</li>
<li>A higher level of reliability. This worker sizing model results in less volatility and a lower frequency of cluster autoscaling events, which lowers the frequency of errors such as zombie tasks and missing task logs.</li>
<li>The legacy <strong>AU</strong> unit is no longer applicable in the context of the worker. You only have to think about CPU, memory, and worker type.</li>
</ul><p>Worker sizing on Astro is now defined in the context of worker queues. For more information about worker sizing, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues">Configure Deployment resources</a>. For a list of supported worker types, see the <a href="resource-reference-aws-hybrid.md#worker-node-types">AWS</a>, <a href="resource-reference-gcp-hybrid.md#worker-node-types">GCP</a>, and <a href="resource-reference-azure-hybrid.md#worker-node-types">Azure</a> resource references.</p><h3>New Maximum Tasks per Worker setting</h3><p>A new <strong>Maximum Tasks per Worker</strong> configuration is now available in the Deployment view of the Cloud UI. Maximum tasks per worker determines the maximum number of tasks that a single worker can process at a time and is the basis of worker autoscaling behavior. It is equivalent to <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#worker-concurrency">worker concurrency</a> in Apache Airflow.</p><p>Previously, maximum tasks per worker was permanently set to 16 and was not configurable on Astro. Now, you can set maximum tasks per worker anywhere between 1 and 64 based on the needs of your tasks. It can be set per worker queue on a Deployment.</p><p>To learn more, see <a href="executors.md#celery-worker-autoscaling-logic">Worker autoscaling logic</a>.</p><h3>New Worker Count (Min-Max) setting</h3><p>A new <strong>Worker Count (Min-Max)</strong> configuration is now available in the Deployment view of the Cloud UI. This value defines the minimum and maximum number of workers that can run at a time.</p><p>Use this setting to fine-tune worker autoscaling behavior in your Deployment. By default, the minimum number of workers is 1 and the maximum is 10.</p><p>To learn more, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queue-settings">Worker queue settings</a>.</p><h3>Support for multiple Organizations</h3><p>A single user account can now belong to multiple Organizations. A user with multiple Organizations can switch to another Organization by clicking on their current Organization's name in the Cloud UI and then clicking <strong>Switch Organization</strong>.</p><p>Note that switching Organizations with the Astro CLI is not yet supported. For more information, see <a href="log-in-to-astro.md#switch-organizations">Switch Organizations</a>.</p><h3>New Azure region (Australia East)</h3><p>You can now <a href="manage-hybrid-clusters.md#create-a-cluster">create an Astro cluster on Azure</a> in Australia East (New South Wales).</p><p>For a list of all Azure regions that Astro supports, see <a href="resource-reference-azure-hybrid.md#supported-regions">Azure resource reference</a>.</p><h3>New Google Cloud Platform regions</h3><p>You can now <a href="manage-hybrid-clusters.md#create-a-cluster">create an Astro cluster on GCP</a> in the following regions:</p><ul>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a>, a microservice that increases resilience by pooling database connections, is now considered highly available on Astro. Every Deployment must now have 2 PgBouncer Pods instead of 1, each assigned to a different node within the cluster. This change protects against pod-level connection issues resulting in <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/tasks.html#zombie-undead-tasks">zombie tasks</a>, which was previously seen during cluster downscaling events. PgBouncer is fully managed by Astronomer and is not configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Airflow scheduler is now configured with an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity">anti-affinity policy</a> to limit the possibility of all schedulers for a single Deployment being impacted by an incident within a single node on an Astro cluster. For users who set <strong>Scheduler Count</strong> in the Cloud UI to 2, this means that those 2 scheduler Pods cannot be assigned to the same node and instead require a minimum of 2 nodes total. To avoid significant increases in cost, 3 or 4 schedulers can share the same 2 nodes and will not necessarily result in a higher node count minimum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For more information on Deployment configurations, see <a href="configure-deployment-resources.md">Configure Deployment resources</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Added tooltips for <a href="deployment-metrics.md#deployment-overview">Deployment overview metrics</a> in the Cloud UI.</li>

<li>You can now access an Organization's AWS external ID from the <strong>Settings</strong> tab of the Cloud UI.</li>
<li>Organizations now need only a single AWS external ID for all clusters. Previously, each cluster required a unique external ID, which added complexity to the installation and cluster creation process.</li>
<li>You can now remove a user from an Organization from the Cloud UI. See <a href="add-user.md#remove-users-from-an-organization">Remove users from an Organization</a>.</li>

These metrics are collected in real time and can provide insight into how your data pipelines are performing over time:</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/access-analytics.png" alt="Analytics menu location"></p><p>For more information about accessing the <strong>Analytics</strong> page and the available metrics, see <a href="deployment-metrics.md#deployment-analytics">Deployment Analytics</a>.</p><h3>Lineage backend upgrade scheduled for all Organizations</h3><p>As part of <a href="https://www.astronomer.io/blog/astronomer-acquires-datakin-the-data-lineage-tool/">Astronomer's acquisition of Datakin</a>, data lineage features are coming soon to Astro. The first step in enabling these features is to implement lineage backends for existing Astro customers.</p><p>Starting on March 31st and continuing over the next couple of weeks, all Astro Deployments on Runtime 4.2.0+ will be upgraded to emit lineage events. As a result of this change, you might start seeing lineage-related scheduler logs such as the following:</p><pre><code class="language-text">[2022-03-30, 12:17:39 UTC] {great_expectations_extractor.py:17} INFO - Did not find great_expectations_provider library or failed to import it
[2022-03-24, 23:40:01 UTC] {client.py:74} INFO - Constructing openlineage client to send events to https://api.astro-astronomer.datakin.com
</code></pre><p>A few additional notes about this upgrade:</p><ul>
<li>You can ignore any lineage logs that indicate an error or failed process, such as the first line in the example logs above. These logs will more accurately reflect the state of your lineage functionality once lineage features are launched on Astro.</li>
<li>Deployments on Runtime 4.2.0+ will be updated to emit data lineage events only after you <a href="deploy-code.md">push code</a>. Until you do so, this change will not be applied.</li>
<li>Because Astronomer is upgrading each customer individually over time, the exact date that you will start seeing these logs will vary.</li>
<li>When you push code to a Deployment on Runtime 4.2.0+ and trigger this update, all other Deployments on Runtime 4.2.0+ in the same Workspace will also restart in order to receive the lineage backend update. If you plan to push code to any Deployment affected by this change, then we recommend doing so at a time where you can tolerate some Airflow components restarting. For more information about expected behavior, see <a href="deploy-code.md#what-happens-during-a-code-deploy">What Happens During a Code Deploy</a>.</li>
</ul><p>For more information about what to expect when lineage tools go live, read Astronomer's <a href="https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-openlineage">OpenLineage and Airflow guide</a>.</p><h3>New AWS regions available</h3><p>You can now <a href="manage-hybrid-clusters.md#create-a-cluster">create new Clusters</a> in:</p><ul>

On Astro, maximum node count represents the total number of EC2 nodes that your cluster can support at any given time. For an Astro cluster on AWS, EC2 nodes are the primary unit of infrastructure required to run a Deployment and its components, including workers and the Airflow scheduler. New clusters have a maximum node count of 20 by default, but the setting can be modified to any value from 2 to 100 at any time.</p><p>Previously, maximum node count was a fixed, global setting that applied to all customers on Astro and could not be configured per cluster. Now, your organization can modify this setting as your workloads evolve and more Deployments are created. Once the limit is reached, your cluster will not be able to auto-scale and worker pods may fail to schedule.</p><p>To update this setting for an existing cluster, reach out to <a href="https://cloud.astronomer.io/support">Astronomer support</a> and provide the name of your cluster and the desired maximum node count.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>In <strong>Resource Settings</strong>, the maximum allowed value for <strong>Worker Resources</strong> has been increased to 400 AU.</li>

The rebrand includes a new Astronomer logo, color palette, and font.</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/new-branding.png" alt="New branding"></p><p>The new Astronomer brand is now reflected both in the <a href="https://cloud.astronomer.io">Cloud UI</a> as well as in the main <a href="https://astronomer.io">Astronomer website</a> and <a href="https://docs.astronomer.io">documentation</a>.</p><p>In addition to visual changes, we've renamed the following high-level Astro components:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Astronomer Cloud CLI</strong> is now <strong>Astro CLI</strong></li>
<li><strong>Astronomer UI</strong> is now <strong>Cloud UI</strong></li>
<li><strong>Astro Runtime</strong> is now <strong>Astro Runtime</strong></li>
</ul><p>We hope you find this exciting. We're thrilled.</p><h3>New Organization roles for users</h3><p>The following Organization-level roles are now supported on Astro:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Organization Member</strong>: This role can view Organization details and membership. This includes everything in the <strong>People</strong>, <strong>Clusters</strong>, and <strong>Settings</strong> page of the Cloud UI. Organization members can create new Workspaces and invite new users to an Organization.</li>
<li><strong>Organization Billing Admin:</strong> This role has all of the Organization Member's permissions, plus the ability to manage Organization-level settings and billing. Organization Billing Admins can access the <strong>Usage</strong> tab of the Cloud UI and view all Workspaces across the Organization.</li>
<li><strong>Organization Owner:</strong> This role has all of the Organization Billing Admin's permissions, plus the ability to manage and modify anything within the entire Organization. This includes Deployments, Workspaces, Clusters, and users. Organization Owners have Workspace Admin permissions to all Workspaces within the Organization.</li>
</ul><p>Organization roles can be updated by an Organization Owner in the <strong>People</strong> tab of the Cloud UI. For more information about these roles, see <a href="user-permissions.md">User permissions</a>.</p><h3>Create new Workspaces from the Cloud UI</h3><p>All users can now create a new Workspace directly from the <strong>Overview</strong> tab of the Cloud UI:</p><p><img src="/img/release-notes/add-workspace.png" alt="Create Workspace button"></p><p>When you create a new Workspace, you will automatically become a Workspace Admin within it and can create Deployments. For more information about managing Workspaces, see <a href="manage-workspaces.md">Manage Workspaces</a>.</p><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where authentication tokens to Astro weren't properly applied when accessing the Airflow UI for a Deployment. This would result in an authenticated user seeing <code>Error: Cannot find this astro cloud user</code> in the Airflow UI.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where long environment variable values would spill out of the <strong>Value</strong> column and onto the <strong>Updated</strong> column in the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> view of a Deployment in the Cloud UI.</li>

Use this page to view DAG runs at a glance, including successes and failures, across all Deployments in a given Workspace. You can also drill down to a specific DAG and see metrics about its recent runs.</p><p><img src="/img/docs/dags-page.png" alt="DAGs page"></p><p>For more information about the <strong>DAGs</strong> page, see <a href="deployment-metrics.md#dag-runs">Deployment metrics</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>All resource settings in the Deployment view of the Astronomer UI now show exact CPU and Memory usage to the right of every slider, previously shown only in Astronomer Units (AUs). This makes it easy to know exactly how many resources you allocate to each component.</li>
<li>A banner now appears in the Astronomer UI if a Deployment is running a version of Astro Runtime that is no longer maintained. To make the most of features and bug fixes, we encourage users to upgrade to recent versions as much as possible.</li>
<li>Added more ways to sort pages that utilize card views, such as the <strong>Deployments</strong> page</li>
<li>Added user account avatars next to usernames in several places across the Cloud UI</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>Removed the <strong>Environment</strong> field from the Deployment view of the Astronomer UI. This field is not currently functional and will be re-added as soon as it is.</li>

By setting up a third-party identity provider, a user in your organization will be automatically logged in to Astro if they're already logged in via your IdP. By adding new Astro users through your IdP's own user management system, Workspace Admins can automatically add new users to their Workspace without those users needing to individually sign up for Astro.</p><p>For more information about this feature read <a href="configure-idp.md">Set up an identity provider</a>.</p><h3>Support for the Astro CLI</h3><p>The Astro CLI (<code>astro</code>) is now generally available as the official command-line tool for Astro. It is a direct replacement of the previously released <code>astro</code> executable and comes with various significant improvements. We encourage all customers to upgrade.</p><p>For more information on the Astro CLI, see <a href="cli/release-notes.md">CLI Release Notes</a>. For install instructions, read <a href="cli/install-cli.md">Install the CLI</a>.</p><h3>Multiple authentication methods for a single user account</h3><p>Astro now supports multiple authentication methods for a single user account. This means that as long as you're using a consistent email address, you now have the flexibility to authenticate with GitHub, Google, username/password, and/or <a href="configure-idp.md">an external identity provider (idP)</a> at any time. Previously, a single user account could only be associated with one authentication method, which could not be changed after the account was created.</p><p>This also means that all Organizations now have GitHub, Google, and username/password authentication methods enabled by default for all users.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Changed the default RDS instance type for new clusters from <code>db.r5.xlarge</code> to <code>db.r5.large</code>, which represents a monthly cost reduction of ~50% for newly provisioned clusters. Customers with existing clusters will need to request a downscale via <a href="https://cloud.astronomer.io/support">Astronomer support</a></li>

When you first log in via the Cloud UI, you now only need to enter the email address for your account. Astro assumes your Organization and brings you directly to your Astro Organization's login screen.</p><p>This change serves as a foundation for future SSO and authentication features. In upcoming releases, users will be able to authenticate via custom identity providers like Okta and Azure Active Directory.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Significant improvements to the load times of various Cloud UI pages and elements.</li>
<li>In the Cloud UI, the tooltips in the <strong>Resource Settings</strong> section of a Deployment's page now show the definition of 1 AU. This should make it easier to translate AU to CPU and Memory.</li>
<li>Scheduler logs in the Cloud UI no longer show <code>DEBUG</code>-level logs.</li>
<li>To ensure that all workers have enough resources to run basic workloads, you can no longer allocate less than 10 AU to <strong>Worker Resources</strong>.</li>

Specifically:</p><ul>
<li>You can now filter logs by type (<code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARN</code>, and <code>ERROR</code>).</li>
<li>The page now shows logs for the past 24 hours instead of the past 30 minutes.</li>
<li>The page now shows a maximum of 500 logs instead of a lower maximum.</li>
<li>When looking at a Deployment's logs, you can return to the Deployment's information using the <strong>Deployment Details</strong> button.</li>
</ul><p><img src="/img/release-notes/log-improvements.png" alt="Logs page in the UI"></p><h3>Removal of worker termination grace period</h3><p>The <strong>Worker Termination Grace Period</strong> setting is no longer available in the Cloud UI or API. Previously, users could set this to anywhere between 1 minute and 24 hours per Deployment. This was to prevent running tasks from being interrupted by a code push. Today, however, existing Celery workers don't have to terminate in order for new workers to spin up and start executing tasks. Instead, existing workers will continue to execute running tasks while a new set of workers gets spun up concurrently to start executing the most recent code.</p><p>To simplify Deployment configuration and reflect current functionality:</p><ul>
<li>The worker Termination Grace Period was removed from the Cloud UI</li>
<li>This value was permanently set to 24 hours for all Deployments on Astro</li>
</ul><p>This does not change or affect execution behavior for new or existing Deployments. For more information, read <a href="deploy-code.md#what-happens-during-a-code-deploy">What Happens During a Code Deploy</a>.</p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>Removed <em>Kubernetes Version</em> column from the <strong>Clusters</strong> table. This value was previously inaccurate and is not needed. The Kubernetes version of any particular Astro cluster is set and modified exclusively by Astro as part of our managed service.</li>

</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>The Cloud UI now has error handling for attempts to access a Deployment that does not exist.</li>
<li>If you attempt to modify an existing secret environment variable, the <strong>Value</strong> field is now blank instead of showing hidden characters.</li>

<li>EBS volumes and S3 buckets are now encrypted by default.</li>
<li>The ability to enable public access to any Amazon S3 bucket on an Astro data plane is now blocked per a new AWS account policy. Previously, public access was disabled by default but could be overridden by a user creating a new S3 bucket with public access enabled. This AWS account policy could be overridden by AWS account owners, but Astronomer strongly recommends against doing so.</li>

From here, you can now see all Workspaces that you have access to, as well as information and settings related to your <strong>Organization</strong>: a collection of specific users, teams, and Workspaces. Many features related to Organizations are coming soon, but the UI now better represents how Organizations are structured and what you can do with them in the future:</p><p><img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note1.png" alt="New global menu in the UI"></p><p>You can now also select specific Workspaces to work in. When you click in to a Workspace, you'll notice the left menu bar is now entirely dedicated to Workspace actions:</p><ul>
<li>The Rocket icon brings you to the <strong>Deployments</strong> menu.</li>
<li>The People icon brings you to the <strong>Workspace Access</strong> menu.</li>
<li>The Gear icon brings you to the <strong>Workspace Settings</strong> menu.</li>
</ul><p>To return to the global menu, you can either click the Astro "A" or click the Workspace name to produce a dropdown menu with your Organization.</p><p><img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note2.png" alt="New Workspace menu in the UI"></p><p>All user configurations can be found by clicking your user profile picture in the upper right corner of the UI. From the dropdown menu that appears, you can both configure user settings and access other Astronomer resources such as documentation and the Astronomer Registry.</p><p><img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note3.png" alt="New profile menu in the UI"></p><h3>Additional improvements</h3><ul>
<li>You can now create new clusters in <code>us-east-2</code> and <code>ca-central-1</code>.</li>
<li>In the Deployment detail page, <strong>Astro Runtime</strong> now shows the version of Apache Airflow that the Deployment's Astro Runtime version is based on.</li>
<li>You can now create or modify an existing Astro cluster to run any size of the <code>t2</code>,<code>t3</code>, <code>m5</code>, or <code>m5d</code> <a href="resource-reference-aws-hybrid.md">AWS EC2 instances</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where a new Deployment's health status did not update unless you refreshed the Cloud UI</li>
